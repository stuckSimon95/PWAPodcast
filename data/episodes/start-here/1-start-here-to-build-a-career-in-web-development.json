{"title":"1. Start Here to Build a Career in Web Development","description":"http://advancedbeginnerchallenge.com – I built a course to get your first job in web development, or upgrade from Junior to mid-level. All done over email for your convenience.\n\nTasks\n\n- Read Steps 1 & 2 from DevelopAJob.com\n\nThis site is a good overview of web development. The author provides additional resources some of which you can purchase. We don't believe you need to pay for an education in web development so bypass those resources. In step 2 we'd ask you to skip the Build Your First Website section. Our second resource provides a more thorough lesson.\n\n- Work through Lesson 1, Building Your First Web Page, from learn.shayhowe.com\n\nShay's lesson is a crash course and a fantastic introduction to HTML and CSS. Technically, it's a lesson about building for the front-end but we think every web developer should know these things.\n\n- Talk to Us\n\nPlease tell us why you want to be a web developer. What are your reasons and what job are you switching from? Leave us a comment below. If you have questions about web dev please ask away. You can also Contact us directly.","pubdate":"2014-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","link":"https://soundcloud.com/starthere-webdev/1-start-here-to-build-a-career-in-web-development","guid":"tag:soundcloud,2010:tracks/234714498","image":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000227802710-27eerh-original.jpg","podcast":{"title":"Start Here: Web Development","description":"Do you want to get your first job as a web developer, or level up in your web dev career??
