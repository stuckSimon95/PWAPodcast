All done over email for your convenience.\n\nHow do you build a portfolio and website with NO work experience? This episode is for ALL BEGINNERS. MUST LISTEN. \n\nYour personal brand is your biggest competitive advantage. You must start building it, NOW. \n\nPS - If you're a follower of Marco Arment, and you don't like talking about \"braaaaandds\" b/c Marco makes fun of it, I'll tell you this, do what he DOES not what he SAYS. He is laughing all the way to the bank, off the back of his ability to build brands. So you decide.\n\nNote - I forgot to mention that there will be another video where we go over how to write blog posts, so don't worry about the \"dummy blog posts\" for now.
