Previously recorded on KAHI Radio 950AM, August 14th, 2015 What are we talking about Dave? Hootsuite? Who?.. Good morning, Sarah how are you I am good… it’s Friday! It is Friday It has been a week a big big week It has… all over the place So yeah let’s talk about Hootsuite what the heck is Hootsuite? Well, let’s home start by saying it’s a social dashboard. It’s a huge time saver Social networking can be kind of ominous and can be a lot of work. You know if you’re doing it right it ~is~ a lot of work but you know the ROI is there. You know one of the problems that many people have social networking is there’s a lot to remember there’s a lot of different accounts: Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Google +, Pinterest… the list goes on. It grows exponentially…daily it seems it really does I concentrate on the big six: Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest and YouTube Those are from my perspective, probably the biggest social networks that. That get the biggest bang for your buck if you do this right. Instagram also is being added soon… it’s going to be part of my big seven. ~In my official list~ But with all that there comes a lot of organization and management and can get a bit crazy with how many examples and how many websites you manage. It has been a while but I can remember when there were a few companies that have created social dashboards meaning a website or in and out there you can go to for free that you can manage all of these social accounts under one single dashboard. So, Hootsuite, in my opinion, appears to be the clear winner in this space. It’s amazing what they have done… over 10 million users now. It allows you, and not only you, but for an entire team securely and safely manage your social space. I’m talking specifically in business now you can definitely use it for personal, but I typically like to talk about business. But you can have team members all over the world help you with your social media management and that’s what Hoostuie is and what it does. They have essentially three different products they offer” The free one or Freemium, which you get to add three social networks. And there is a Pro version of Hootsuite, which you can have up to what is it that I think you can have up to 100 and social profiles and then there’s the Enterprise version of Hootsuite which has unlimited everything. And the Pro it’s 10 bucks a month. It starts at 10 bucks a month the enterprise you have to call because enterprises obviously vary in size. They offer all this that really affordable rates in my opinion. It’s a big time saver. It really is a big time-saver because you can look at a single screen and manage the flow of all this information. And it isn’t just about marketing either. It goes far beyond. I’ve touched on this before but you can do this for sales you can do this for customer service you can do this for for your marketing efforts you can do it to manage your analytics. They have a killer set up set of analytics in there to find out what’s going on in your company. Everyone can have a separate logins and the big boss can check out what’s going on… everybody on down the line can help the company grow socially. And the fact of the matter is that if you’re not paying attention to this you were probably spinning your wheels I fight this spell all the time with customers saying “Dave I don’t have time to do this.” And my answer’s always same, “You don’t have time not to.” This is where business is at. And the future And the future… it’s only growing. So it doesn’t mean it needs to be impossible for you I don’t care how big or how small you are there are tools available so be open-minded about it.

It’s that time of the week… one of our favorite times of the week when we have our Web Wizard Dave Naves with Daveworks in the studio it’s the Web in Plain English and today it’s Pinterest and how to make money… good morning Dave Dave: Good morning, Sarah. how are you doing doing well, end of the week Sarah: Yeah always good on Friday when we have the segment because the end the work week and always really good information that you can use and understand so Pinterest, how do we make some money with Pinterest? It confuses the crap out of me. Dave Ha ha ha, Pinterest yeah, you know, it’s probably best to just explain to those who don’t know what interest is as they describe themselves they are a free personalized media platform. so what does that mean? People share pictures, (and videos) that’s what it means… billions and billions pictures at this point of images imagery that interests people, right? Dave: You pin these these pins with pictures that are actually called “pins.” Think of it like having a bulletin board. You take your pin and you pin it to your board. You can have an unlimited number of pins and an unlimited number of boards and its it’s actually very cool. You know, in the beginning I didn’t taste my own medicine and thought “here we go…another social network” and then it took one of my clients to kinda smack me in the face a bit and say “Dave, people think visually.” I thought, Oh… you’re so right. I get. So I immediately, years ago, I joined and I saw how cool it was in the fact that its really brilliant. The business model they have is brilliant because people love looking at pictures. People love sharing pictures and think about it. reading even the comic strip you like it. You like to look at that the imagery and maybe at a couple of captions below, reading you know the comic strip. A lot of people just don’t like reading but they like looking at the pictures. So that’s what Pinterest is about. And one of the things that I teach in in my business is, I’m always trying to make businesses money. One of the things that people might not understand is that you can make a heck of a lot of money using Pinterest… because…and there’s both passive and active ways to do this. Dave: Now, one of the most brilliant moves I’ve seen was made by a company like Nordstrom. They make tons of money through Pinterest. I can guarantee you that every… if you’re in there, on their main account, https://www.pinterest.com/nordstrom, you will see that they have probably every product they offer as a picture on Pinterest. You click once, it gives you a detailed view. You click again, it takes you right to buy it now page. Now that’s active…that’s an active form if sales they use massive traffic that goes on a t Pinterest Sarah: High click-through rates Dave: Oh my.. I mean, if you think about it, they are farming (mispoke: “getting”) their traffic out to Pinterest for free…rather they pay their employees… I’m sure the don’t mind spending tons of money and paying their employees to make it happen, people who were know exactly what fashion is all about.. I’m talking about purses, shoes, anything that Nordsrtom sells is on there. And people click… they like it you click it they’ll often buy it. They make big bucks. So that’s an example of an ~active~ sale on Pinterest. Dave: Pinterest is bound by nothing. People all over the world with all sorts of interests, pin their pictures to their boards. So whether you are in music, you’re in real estate you’re in construction, you’re into clothing or software, its all out there. Many people just pin and it’s fun and you look and you share you share pictures. Whether its gardens I mean I’ve picked up some awesome landscaping pictures off of others’ ideas on landscaping!’ Sarah: Amazing!

So I’ve stopped doing that. Most folks just want a computer that WORKS! So, here it is: Are you thinking of getting a new laptop for yourself? Maybe a gift? You might want to check out the Chromebook. Note: Some some of the below links are affiliate-based. All are products and services with which I have personal experience. I am recommending them because I feel they are both useful and helpful… not because of any possible commission. Truly, //D Here’s why you should check out the Chromebook: It’s Affordable The Chromebook retails between $199 – $500, depending on specs. Yep, pretty darn cheap compared to anything else out there. (I have this HP Chromebook) It’s Fast! (even boots in 8 seconds) Nope, I’m not kidding, I couldn’t believe it myself when I first heard about it, but it’s true. (proof below) This computer really is a workhorse. I turn it on, it opens Chrome and I’m off and running. It’s perfect for the Web This computer is all about the web… you open it and start browsing. Read the news, check your email, update your Facebook status… it’s virtually limitless. Or maybe you even want to start blogging… if so, look no further. You’ll Never Lose Your Work It doesn’t have a hard drive. WHAT?? Yep, all your work is saved out in the cloud (Google Drive – AND YES, YOU CAN ACCESS AND EDIT OFFLINE) And yes, it also has a “downloads” folder for files you download. This might sound scary at first, but let me put it to you like this: Would you rather have your 1 hard drive fail (and they always do after a few years) or have your work automatically backed up out on *many* Google servers? Is it secure? In short, YES, VERY. You Can Open and Edit Most Every Microsoft File Type Yep, Excel, Word, PPT, and many more file types your Chromebook (via Google Drive) can open, view and with a small conversion, edit and share the files. But you don’t really need Microsoft at all any more. Google provides everything you need to be productive: Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Contacts, Task List, Chat, G+ Video Hangouts, Google Voice, Wallet… the list goes on. Oh yeah, with Google, most everything is FREE with a massive amount of storage. And you’ll always have the latest and greatest software automatically updated.

You simply fill up your Buffer with a click of a mouse and the BufferApp automatically posts them for you throughout the day. (at the best times for your particular audience) Why should you care about Buffer? Social networks / micro blogs typically work on a timeline, (latest posts on top) which means that *most* of your audience never sees your posts and shares. If you’re like me and can only research and post every so often, then scheduled posts work much better. How much better? By scheduling your posts correctly, you can increase the number of views and clicks by 200%, double your retweets and significantly increase your Klout score. What the Buffer Dashboard looks like: (click image to zoom) How to Use Buffer Essentially, you add the browser extension for Buffer, (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) find any page content out on the web, click the Buffer Icon, which will add it to your Buffer account.

You may be saying to yourself: “I’m barely able to deal with Facebook, Linkedin and Twitter… why should I learn another?” Google+ truly is a game-changing social network that makes sharing on the web far easier with much less noise. How is it a game-changer? Google is the most popular search engine in the world and anything you post “publicly” on G+ is indexed way up there within Google’s Search Results. (So ask yourself: why wouldn’t I want better results on Google by posting on G+?) You can share your insights, links and photos, chat with up to 9 people at once via G+ Hangouts and divide your contacts into G+ Circles. There are also tons of G+ Games and Instant Search always available within Google+ and the G+ mobile version of G+ has made available G+ Instant Upload and G+ Messenger to make your sharing experience easier A quick peak at Google+ Explore Google+ Circles (think friends lists) Within Circles, you can share ideas and knowledge with different people and businesses.. Circles make it easy to organize and categorize your friends in one circle, best frinds in another, your family in another, customers in yet another, and even the town weirdo in a circles all by himself .=) (but they won’t know what circles they are in) Explore Google+ Hangouts (think Video Conferencing, but waaaaay better and easier) Google+ Hangouts are a way of easily communicating with others via video. (watch out Skype and WebEx!) This feature is probably the most powerful within the G+ Arsenal. You can communicate with up to 9 people at a time…. just start a hangout, add who you want there and bam, you’re hanging out! Explore Google+ Games (think time waster – jk!) ;^ ) Are you into playing games? G+ has an entire game room just for you. You can play and share with others who have similar gamining interests. Google+ Search (think search within your biz and personal networks) Hey, remember it’s Google Search… and there is no beter search than that. You can use Google’s phenomenal search algorithm to search your entire social presence. From your friends to experts in certain fields, G+ Search can provide you with immediate results from your circles, news feed globally and public G+ posts. Google+ Mobile (think Google+ on the road) Google+ Instant Upload (think automatic uploading of pics without the fuss) We all love taking photos and sharing them, but pulling those photos from your mobile device and uploading them to the web can be a pain … but with G+ Instant Uploadm it’s automatic so you don’t even need to think about it. Just remembered, keep your loved ones safe by turning off the geo-tag feature in your smartphone. (protect your privacy) Google+ Messenger (think sms/texting/chatting within your chosen groups – *huge* timesaver) Find it hard to text or chat with a bunch of people at once? G+ Messenger consolidates all those separate conversations into one simple group chat, so everyone can converse at once. Very cool! Google+ Sound Interesting?

An unbelievably cool way to communicate… for FREE!

Previously recorded on KAHI Radio 950AM, August 21st, 2015 Here are some short and sweet videos explaining how it all works: Or, if you just want to go for it, visit Google Voice now. How Google Voice Works: You can choose the account option that works suits you best. Below are the different account types and how they work: Google Voice Number: With this option you get a brand new custom Google number that can receive calls from all of your phones. This means that whenever someone calls your Google number you can set it to ring all of your phones (ex. mobile, home, work phone) or just certain phones. If you just want to use your existing home or work phone, you can get one of these, plug one end into your Internet connection and the other into your phone. Boom, done. FREE phone within the US and *super* cheap International Rates. Google Voice Lite (Voicemail Only) You can have the same voicemail for all your mobile phones. Simply add your existing numbers to Google Voice and then create your own settings, including: personalized greetings, voicemail transcriptions and share voicemail messages.It provides voicemail that feels like email. Here’s exactly how I set it up: Signed up for new Google Voice number Forwarded the old office number for a few months ($28/month – thanks for the ripping me off, AT&T – that’s one of the reasons I left) Plugged in a headset directly to computer to make and receive calls through the Gmail interface Also got my regular office phone to work (not forwarded) with the new Google Voice Number by buying this cool OBi110 Bridge Just plugged one end of this little box into my existing router, and the other into my standard phone Made 1 tiny change within my Google Voice settings BAM, done! Happy with all the features? YES!
