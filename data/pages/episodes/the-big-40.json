Over the first 40 episodes they have discussed everything from web design and development to startups and dog related tech. Today the focus has shifted and includes topics including remote working, working in the web industry, productivity, hipster beards and much more. Released irregularly but always produced with passion The Back to Front Show runs for around 40 minutes per episode and comes to you from the beautiful West Country in the UK.
