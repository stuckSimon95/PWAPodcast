All done over email for your convenience.\n\nLearn a framework not a language. The framework is a trojan horse for the knowledge you need of the language.\n\n- Learn Rails, not Ruby.\n- Learn Django, not Python.\n- Learn Angular/Ember/React+Redux, not JavaScript.\n- Learn Phoenix, not Elixir.\n- Learn .NET, not C#.\n- Learn Laravel, not PHP.\n- Etc etc.\n\nA few notes from today's episode:\n\n1. Look around at the industry you want to be in, what are other people spending 80% of their time on, that is only getting them 20% of the result? Hard to identify what exactly that is? If you have trouble with this, just identify what people spend 80% of their time on, and do the opposite. This is what makes people massively successful, mark my words.\n\n2. SKIP OVER what you identified in #1. SKIP OVER what most people are doing. This is taking MASSIVE ACTION. Massive action is relative. Relative to the rest of humans on this planet, are you taking massive action? \n\nHere are some examples of taking massive action:\n\n- Learn a Framework: Deploy ANYTHING to Heroku (that only you will see) by tomorrow. No excuses.\n\n- Learn a Framework: complete 1 page that has some functionality you agree with yourself ahead of time, deploy it to Heroku, then send to 2 friends on Facebook and ask them to try and use it. \n\n- Go start interviewing for jobs, NOW. WHY WAIT? Stop sitting around and take action. \n\n- Want to start a podcast? Launch a crappy first version by TOMORROW. \n\n- Want to write a book? Launch a crappy first eBook by next Monday. No matter what.\n\nStop trying to make everything perfect on the first try, just focus on making stuff good on the second try. \n\nYour first handful of job interviews, book chapters, podcast episodes, programming projects - they will all SUCK on the first go around. BE OKAY WITH THAT and push forward and keep going and you will advance beyond the crowd. Most people either A) get obsessed with making the first version perfect and never go anywhere, or B) feel so depressed from their first version being a failure they never go anywhere. SKIP OVER ALL THAT, and get somewhere. \n\nOr don't, and continue to take small actions, and remain in limbo for the rest of your life. \n\nThis is my challenge for you. Are you up for it? Tweet me @dainmiller and let me know you are taking massive actions. Ask me questions on the best massive action to take. I will hold you accountable. You aren't allowed to do small things if you are following me. I will make sure you are accountable.

November 2 marked my two year anniversary with Tellago and I thought I would try to express what these past two years have been like today, Thanksgiving. Back in July 2010, after about 8 months after joining Tellago I wrote about my experiences and thankfulness at the time.
