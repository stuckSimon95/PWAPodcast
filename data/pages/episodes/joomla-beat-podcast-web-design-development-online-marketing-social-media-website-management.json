I have to stress, thats the relicensing of the Joomla Framework and not of the Joomla CMS itself.This is where some of the original confusion came from. There were also some assumptions that the license version was something different which would mean the GPLv2 license of the Joomla CMS would have to change and this we don't want to happen.I spent a Sunday afternoon with Andrew Eddie, one of the Joomla Framework developers, asking him about what were the implications of the license change, how it would affect my business and many others around the world. Andrew explains all from the point of view for changing the license to LGPL, and I welcome someone else to join me on the podcast to speak for the other side of the argument to keep the Joomla Framework as GPL.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JoomlaBeat/~4/NhXGhLd6FqY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","pubdate":"2014-02-25T22:57:01.000Z","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JoomlaBeat/~3/NhXGhLd6FqY/ep52-joomla-framework-licensing-lgpl-or-","guid":"https://api.spreaker.com/episode/4112288","podcast":{"title":"Joomla Beat Podcast | Web design, development, online marketing, social media & website management","description":"Weekly Joomla podcast helping website designers, developers and owners design, develop, manage and market their Joomla website. \r\t   \rProduced by the expert Joomla service providers from PB Web Development.
