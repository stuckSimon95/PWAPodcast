We talked about what the risks are, who's responsibility web security should be and what we can do to build more secure sites.\n\nTim gave us two security focused Toolstars. Visualping (https://visualping.io) and Versionista (https://versionista.com) monitor sites for changes. They can be used to ensure your sites haven't been tampered with.\n\nFor our Jukebox picks, Tim chose Postmodern Jukebox's cover of Meghan Trainor’s 'All About That Bass'. I Chose ‘Gathers In Puddles’ by Origamibiro, who also very kindly lets us use one of his track as our 'theme tune'. Ben had no pick this week... bad Ben!

He talks us through some of the advantages of adopting Progressive Enhancement (PE) versus more traditional approaches. We also discuss barriers that might prevent us using PE and Aaron makes some useful recommendations. \n\nA much more in-depth discussion of the topic is available in Aaron's book 'Adaptive Web Design: Crafting Rich Experiences with Progressive Enhancement'. \n\nThis week's jukebox picks are definitely going on the Relative Paths Alt Playlist! I started with 'Bambro Koyo Ganda (featuring Innov Gnawa)' by Bonobo. Mark then gave us 'Kick Jump Twist' by Sylvan Esso. Brilliant and needed an immediate second listen. Finally Aaron hit us with post-punk classic 'Teen Age Riot' by Sonic Youth, and a great story. He also urged us to check out The Chameleons following his Instagram vid of 'Script Of The Bridge' on deck.\n\nSubscribe and keep in touch: \niTunes - https://relativepaths.uk/it\nStitcher - https://relativepaths.uk/st\nSoundCloud - https://relativepaths.uk/sc\nAudioBoom - https://relativepaths.uk/ab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/relativepaths\nFacebook - https://facebook.com/relativepaths\n\nThe music we use for various intro bits, stings and outro is ‘Vitreous Detachment’ by Origamibiro, used with kind permission.\n\n– Ben\n\nLinks:\n\nAaron's response to Josh Korr – https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/insert-clickbait-headline-about-progressive-enhancement-here\n\nAaron's site – https://www.aaron-gustafson.com\n\nThe True Cost of Progressive Enhancement – http://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/the-true-cost-of-progressive-enhancement\n\nAaron's book (which I'm still reading during coffee breaks!) –\n https://adaptivewebdesign.info","pubdate":"2017-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","link":"https://soundcloud.com/relativepaths/48-progressive-enhancement-with-aaron-gustafson","guid":"tag:soundcloud,2010:tracks/317326313","image":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000217452443-rs1xgv-original.jpg","podcast":{"title":"Relative Paths | Web Development and stuff like that","description":"Podcast by Mark Phoenix and Ben Hutchings","image":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000130036366-ai137n-original.png"}},{"slug":"47-dogmatism-with-chris-coyier-tagsoundcloud2010tracks314224279","title":"47: Dogmatism | With Chris Coyier","description":"This was one of the most interesting, thoughtful and funny conversations we've had. We spoke to Chris Coyier about dogmatism (the expression of an opinion or belief as if it were a fact) in the web industry. We talked about why it happens, what we can to do be less dogmatic ourselves and how to deal with dogmatic people and their bombastic opinions.\n\nOur Toolstar this week was CodePen Projects, zero setup, full-featured front end web development environment, right in the browser. Chris talked us through it, and it sounds pretty great. We like all the CodePen things.\n\nIt was a diverse Jukebox this week. I chose 'A Tender History In Rust' by Do Say Make Think. Ben chose 'Eve' by Anchorsong, it's very Ben. And Chris chose 'The Stable Song' by Gregory Alan Isakov, and had a very cool story of meeting him IRL.

Malc gives some good advice to Freelancers working with Creative Agencies, positioning oneself in the 'industry', and up-selling to clients.\n\nWe made some technical mistakes in the on-site recording of this episode so the interview starts part-way through, and the voice quality is pretty ropey! Sorry... won't do it again ;)\n\nThis week's Dukebox is triple-barrelled! Malc chose a live c1970 acoustic version of 'Hear My Train a Comin' by Hendrix. My choice was Nick Drake's 'Three Hours' from 1969.
