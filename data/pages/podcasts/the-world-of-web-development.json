So I wanted to give you a little of the back story and update you on where CodeWinds is going.</p>\n<p>When I launched CodeWinds in 2013, my goal was to bring you the latest web developer news and training which I would deliver through my blog, podcast, and video courses. Well just after I started working on content, a local enterprise reached out with an ultra important need to rapidly build a scalable resilient platform for a large client. I didn’t even know the specifics of their client until the launch a year later. Well this enterprise was MasterCard. Our client turned out to be none other than Apple, and we  were building the MasterCard ApplePay system. Wow.</p>\n<p>This was such an awesome opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills to such an important project. When I joined the team, I intended to continue delivering CodeWinds content in my spare time, however the project demanded more of my focus than I anticipated, especially as we approached the launch. We poured our hearts into making sure that our platform was battle ready. And what happened on launch day? … well everything just worked.</p>\n<p> It was one of those priceless moments when everything comes together, like a symphony of technology and collaboration. The launch was described by some the senior staff as being possibly the most successful MasterCard launch of all time. It was complex, involving so many partners, yet it came together beautifully. I was blessed to be a part of this amazing team.</p>\n<a name=\"regrets\"></a><h3 id=\"regrets\">Regrets</h3>\n<p> Yet in all the success we had with this project, I failed you my CodeWinds community. I focussed so completely on the project that my content creation ground to a halt. I should have communicated with you, so you wouldn’t be left hanging and wondering what had happened. For that I am truly sorry, and ask for your forgiveness.</p>\n<a name=\"i_m_back_and_focussed_on_codewinds\"></a><h3 id=\"i-m-back-and-focussed-on-codewinds\">I’m back and focussed on CodeWinds</h3>\n<p>Fast forward to today, what’s in store for my future and that of CodeWinds. Well I am happy to say that I’m back. After much soul searching, I departed from the MasterCard team to work on CodeWinds fulltime. My desire is to bring you the best leading edge full stack web developer content.</p>\n<a name=\"react_js_and_other_course_plans\"></a><h3 id=\"react-js-and-other-course-plans\">React.js and other course plans</h3>\n<p>In the past few months, I have been doing a deep dive into React.js and its family. I’m so excited by the development and innovation going on in the React.js community.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I believe the ideas and technology developing from the React.js community will profoundly influence how we build web and mobile apps.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m currently planning a course on React.js and then will follow it with other topics like ES6, Hapi, Node, building resilient systems, and using HTML5.</p>\n<p>I’ll offer this material in a variety of ways, but the primary mechanism will be online courses with training videos and exercises that you can follow at your own pace or in conjunction with those in a class. These will be real world projects similar to that which you would build at your companies.</p>\n<p> I don’t like the simple hello world style examples which are so far removed from our real projects that it is hard to see how you really would do things in practice. So these will be real projects solving real problems including proper testing and error handling. I’ll deliver these video lessons in bite sized chunks that build on each other, so you can go directly to a specific topic or learn from beginning to end. I’ll continue to blog and produce this podcast with related materials to complement all of these areas.</p>\n<a name=\"provide_your_input\"></a><h3 id=\"provide-your-input\">Provide your input</h3>\n<p>To be successful in this endeavor, I really depend on your input for the technologies and training you would like me to cover, especially the key topics or questions that you struggle with when building complex web applications. I just want to make sure I am working on the most pertinent topics for you. So if you could just spare a few moments, I would really appreciate your input, head over to <a href=\"http://codewinds.com/topics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://codewinds.com/topics</a> which will redirect you to a Google Doc.</p>\n<p>Check out the major categories, questions, topics, and provide your own. If you see existing ideas that resonate and interest you, please add a +1 next to them so I can gauge interest and priorities. If you have ideas for the types of apps we might build, please add that as well. I’m open to all your ideas and needs, just add them to the doc.</p>\n<a name=\"thanks_for_your_support\"></a><h3 id=\"thanks-for-your-support\">Thanks for your support</h3>\n<p>I want to thank you for staying with me through this prolonged start and I am excited about what we’ll be able to accomplish together in the future.</p>\n<p>I hope you are subscribed to my leading edge member list because you won’t want to miss the next episode of the CodeWinds podcast on React.js with Michael Jackson and Ryan Florence. We had a fantastic discussion about React.js and I think you’ll start to see why I am excited about everything coming out of the React.js community.</p>\n<a name=\"michael_jackson_and_ryan_florence_react_js_training_discount\"></a><h3 id=\"michael-jackson-and-ryan-florence-react-js-training-discount\">Michael Jackson and Ryan Florence React.js training discount</h3>\n<p>Michael and Ryan have launched some React.js training starting this April and for CodeWinds listeners you can get a $300 discount to their San Francisco training this April 16-17, 2015.

I have to stress, thats the relicensing of the Joomla Framework and not of the Joomla CMS itself.\r\nThis is where some of the original confusion came from. There were also some assumptions that the license version was something different which would mean the GPLv2 license of the Joomla CMS would have to change and this we don't want to happen.\r\nI spent a Sunday afternoon with Andrew Eddie, one of the Joomla Framework developers, asking him about what were the implications of the license change, how it would affect my business and many others around the world. Andrew explains all from the point of view for changing the license to LGPL, and I welcome someone else to join me on the podcast to speak for the other side of the argument to keep the Joomla Framework as GPL.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JoomlaBeat/~4/NhXGhLd6FqY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

React gets some of its inspiration from how game engines acehieve awesome performance in their rendering pipeline.</p>\n<p>React can be used in the browser and on the server with node.js so you can have single page apps that are fully indexable by the search engines and have instant load characteristics. React has pluggable backends so it can be used to target the DOM, HTML, canvas, SVG, and other formats.</p>\n<p>The ideas and concepts behind React are very compelling, I encourage you to give it a look.</p>\n<div id=\"toc\"><ol><li><a href=\"#episode_info\">Episode Info</a></li><li><a href=\"#episode_notes\">Episode Notes</a><ol><li><a href=\"#interview_timeline\">Interview timeline</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=\"#notable_users_of_react\">Notable users of React</a></li><li><a href=\"#resources\">Resources</a><ol><li><a href=\"#links_from_show\">Links from Show</a></li><li><a href=\"#online_training_courses\">Online Training Courses</a></li><li><a href=\"#tutorials\">Tutorials</a></li><li><a href=\"#other\">Other</a></li></ol></li></ol></div>\n\n<a name=\"episode_info\"></a><h2 id=\"episode-info\">Episode Info</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Episode: CW 004</li>\n<li>Published: March 16th, 2014</li>\n<li>Tags: js, nodejs,UI,framework</li>\n<li>Duration: 42:17</li>\n<li>Updated: 2014-05-01 Added links to great articles by Reto Schläpfer</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"episode_notes\"></a><h2 id=\"episode-notes\">Episode Notes</h2>\n<a name=\"interview_timeline\"></a><h3 id=\"interview-timeline\">Interview timeline</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2:08 - What is React and why might people want to use it?</li>\n<li>3:08 - The symbiotic relationship of ClojureScript and React</li>\n<li>4:54 - The history of React and why it was created</li>\n<li>9:43 - Updating web page with React without using data binding, a better approach inspired by game engines</li>\n<li>13:11 - Using the virtual DOM to change the browser DOM</li>\n<li>13:57 - Programming with React, render target HTML, canvas, other.

Using parameters is important in create SQL to prevent SQL injection attacks where users enter malicious data into forms to gain access to your database. SQL builders help you to use parameters and avoid these attacks.</p>\n<p>Having used Hibernate for Java and Active Record with Rails (a couple of popular Object Relational Mappers, I’ve seen what a ORM’s can do and they are nice when they do what you want, but all to often once you get into more advanced uses, they tend to get in your way and you are fighting with the tool to try to get it to generate the SQL you want.</p>\n<p>So a SQL builder which allows you to create just the right queries but helps you deal with parameterization and tokens, provides a great balance. It stays out of your way and just helps with the bookkeeping. The sql it generates and the parameter array can be used directly with your database module like the <code>pg</code> Postgres client.</p>\n<a name=\"sqlbits_-_node_js_sql_builder\"></a><h3 id=\"sqlbits-node-js-sql-builder\">SQLBits - Node.js SQL builder</h3>\n<p>I reviewed a bunch of Node.js SQL builders listed in NPM and I was not happy with any of them until I found <a href=\"https://github.com/williamwicks/sqlbits\" title=\"SQLBits GitHub project page\">SQLBits</a>.</p>\n<p>Too many of them seemed complicated or too integrated bordering on ORM capabilities. I wanted something that was simple and just server a single purpose to help me build good parameterized queries. I didn’t want it to run my queries or perform schema manipulation. I don’t want a complete new DSL (domain specific language) or API that I need to learn. SQL is already a DSL that does that just fine, but it can get tricky to manage as queries get complex.</p>\n<p>SQLBits is a simple tool which helps you generate SQL but stays out of your way. You can create custom tuned SQL which pulls back only what is needed over the wire and have it manage the parameters and tokens.</p>\n<a name=\"sqlbits_install\"></a><h3 id=\"sqlbits-install\">SQLBits Install</h3>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"hljs bash\">npm install sqlbits --save  <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># install and add to package.json</span>\n</code></pre>\n<a name=\"simple_example\"></a><h3 id=\"simple-example\">Simple example</h3>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"hljs javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> bits = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'sqlbits'</span>);\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> SQL = bits.SQL;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> $ = bits.$;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> AND = bits.AND;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> params = { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">max_price</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">10.00</span>, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">clearance</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span> };\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> query =\n  SQL(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'select name, desc from widgets'</span>)\n   .WHERE(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'price &lt; '</span>, $(params.max_price), AND,\n          <span class=\"hljs-string\">'clearance = '</span>, $(params.clearance))\n   .ORDERBY(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'name asc'</span>);\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// sql: select name, desc from widgets WHERE(price &lt; $1 AND clearance = $2) ORDER BY name asc</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'sql: '</span>, query.sql);\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'params: '</span>, query.params); <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// params: [ 10, true ]</span>\n</code></pre>\n<a name=\"additional_criteria\"></a><h3 id=\"additional-criteria\">Additional criteria</h3>\n<p>You can add in additional filter criteria with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>AND</code> - bits.AND</li>\n<li><code>OR</code> - bits.OR</li>\n<li><code>BETWEEN</code> - bits.BETWEEN (discussed in depth later)</li>\n<li><code>.IN(array)</code></li>\n<li><code>$</code> - bits.$ - used to specify that something is a parameter <code>$(params.foo)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"joins\"></a><h3 id=\"joins\">Joins</h3>\n<p>With relational data, you will often need to join tables together, and to maintain good performance these joins may need to be optimized.

You only have to create one complex query that includes all the possible filter criteria, and SQLBits will eliminate the parts where the parameters involved are <code>undefined</code>.</p>\n<p>Also by using the <code>BETWEEN</code> command, SQLBits handles all four scenarios automatically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>min and max are defined: <code>price BETWEEN $1 AND $2</code></li>\n<li>only min is defined: <code>price &gt;= $1</code></li>\n<li>only max is defined: <code>price &lt;= $1</code></li>\n<li>neither min or max is defined: the criteria is eliminated</li>\n</ul>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"hljs javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> bits = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'sqlbits'</span>);\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> SQL = bits.SQL;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> $ = bits.$;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> AND = bits.AND;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> BETWEEN = bits.BETWEEN;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">queryByParam</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">params</span>) </span>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> query =\n    SQL(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'select name, desc from widgets'</span>)\n      .WHERE(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'price'</span>, BETWEEN(params.min, params.max), AND,\n             <span class=\"hljs-string\">'clearance = '</span>, $(params.clearance))\n      .ORDERBY(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'name asc'</span>);\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> query;\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> query = queryByParam({ <span class=\"hljs-attr\">min</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2.00</span>, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">max</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">10.00</span>, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">clearance</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span> });\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// sql: select name, desc from widgets WHERE(price BETWEEN $1 AND $2 AND clearance = $3) ORDER BY name asc</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'sql: '</span>, query.sql);\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'params: '</span>, query.params); <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// params: [ 2, 10, true ]</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> query = queryByParam({ <span class=\"hljs-attr\">min</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2.00</span> });\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// sql: select name, desc from widgets WHERE price &gt;=$1 ORDER BY name asc</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'sql: '</span>, query.sql);\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'params: '</span>, query.params); <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// params: [ 2 ];</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> query = queryByParam({ <span class=\"hljs-attr\">max</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">10.00</span> });\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// sql: select name, desc from widgets WHERE price &lt;=$1 ORDER BY name asc</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'sql: '</span>, query.sql);\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'params: '</span>, query.params); <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// params: [ 10 ]</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> query = queryByParam({ <span class=\"hljs-attr\">min</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2.00</span>, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">max</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">10.00</span> });\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// sql: select name, desc from widgets WHERE price BETWEEN $1 AND $2 ORDER BY name asc</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'sql: '</span>, query.sql);\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'params: '</span>, query.params); <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// params: [ 2, 10 ]</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> query = queryByParam({ <span class=\"hljs-attr\">min</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2.00</span>, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">clearance</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span> });\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// sql:  select name, desc from widgets WHERE(price &gt;=$1 AND clearance = $2) ORDER BY name asc</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'sql: '</span>, query.sql);\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'params: '</span>, query.params); <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// params: [ 2, true ]</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>In my opinion, this is one of the killer features of SQLBits. You create a single complex query with all the possible filters and then just provide a params object to SQLBits with a parameters object having the keys that the user wants to filter by, and it provides the customized query.</p>\n<p>This eliminates all the conditional logic which is hard to test and debug when it fails and you are left with a single complex query to maintain.</p>\n<a name=\"inserts\"></a><h3 id=\"inserts\">Inserts</h3>\n<p>Inserting data into your tables by key is as simple as providing an object to SQLBits and it will add all the keys and values.</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"hljs javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> bits = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'sqlbits'</span>);\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> INSERT = bits.INSERT;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">insertWidget</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">obj</span>) </span>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> INSERT.INTO(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'widgets'</span>, obj);\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> query = insertWidget({ <span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'foo'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">desc</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'Foo man'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">price</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">23.45</span> });\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">//INSERT INTO widgets (name,desc,price) SELECT $1,$2,$3</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'sql: '</span>, query.sql);\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'params: '</span>, query.params);

It focuses on simply helping you build the SQL by managing the parameterization process, but you can still use the full power of SQL to create optimized queries and even special features that a particular SQL engine provides.</p>\n<p>One of its killer features is the ability to create custom filter queries based on whether parameters are defined, so you can create one complex query which is relaxed based on the parameters defined at runtime.</p>\n<p>Check out SQLBits, and let me know what you think. You can leave a comment in the discussion secion of this episode. I find it to be a great tool to help me generate SQL for Postgres and hope you will too.</p>",

            "description": "<p>This is a review of the <a href=\"http://hapijs.com\" title=\"Hapijs main site\">Hapi</a> 2.0 functionality unveiled last Monday, Jan 27, 2014 at &amp;yet. The event was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3u0XkbhleA&amp;t=1461\" title=\"Eran Hammer Hapi 2.0 live stream from &amp;yet\">live streamed</a> so I was able to watch and take notes. Eran Hammer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eranhammer\" title=\"Eran Hammer twitter\">@eranhammer</a>, a Walmart labs engineer and lead developer for Hapi shared a top to bottom feature discussion including the new changes for version 2. <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52139546/hapi%20yet%3F.pdf\" title=\"Eran&apos;s slides for the Hapi 2.0 live stream\">Eran’s Slides</a></p>\n<p>My goal with this podcast is to mention some of the key changes with Hapi 2 and how you would leverage them in your code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/spumko/hapi/master/images/hapi.png\" alt=\"hapi-png\" title=\"Hapi\"></p>\n<p>This review and Eran’s presentation are done such that you do not need have a familiarity with Hapi to get value, new users should come away with some understanding of Hapi and how it can be useful for building robust web applications.</p>\n<div id=\"toc\"><ol><li><a href=\"#episode_info\">Episode Info</a></li><li><a href=\"#episode_notes\">Episode Notes</a><ol><li><a href=\"#background\">Background</a></li><li><a href=\"#routes_caching_state\">Routes, Caching, State</a></li><li><a href=\"#plugins\">Plugins</a></li><li><a href=\"#authorization\">Authorization</a></li><li><a href=\"#ops\">Ops</a></li><li><a href=\"#postmile_example_app\">Postmile example app</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=\"#major_breaking_changes\">Major breaking changes</a></li><li><a href=\"#resources\">Resources</a></li><li><a href=\"#summary\">Summary</a></li></ol></div>\n\n<a name=\"episode_info\"></a><h2 id=\"episode-info\">Episode Info</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Episode: CW 002</li>\n<li>Published: February 1st, 2014</li>\n<li>Tags: nodejs, hapijs</li>\n<li>Duration: 21:46</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"episode_notes\"></a><h2 id=\"episode-notes\">Episode Notes</h2>\n<a name=\"background\"></a><h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>show notes <a href=\"http://codewinds.com/podcast/002.html\">http://codewinds.com/podcast/002.html</a></li>\n<li>I have a link to the original live stream, the content starts at about 24 minutes in, so the URL in the show notes jumps directly to that spot.</li>\n<li>Hapi is the awesome open source web framework created by Walmart Labs.</li>\n<li>The Hapi framework grew out of years of development first at Yahoo as Sled, later renamed Postmile, then at Walmart Labs.</li>\n<li>Initially Eran tried to build on Express a popular web framework, but found issues with plugin order, undocumented dependencies, fragility with large team use.</li>\n<li>Hapi was developed by Walmart Labs for their mobile division</li>\n<li>Hapi is built as a scalable web framework that they could use to evolve their system over time.</li>\n<li>Initiallly used to reverse proxy or pass through requests to their existing backend written in java or other languages.</li>\n<li>Then decorate, batch, and begin to replace legacy code with new code in Node.js</li>\n<li>It ran 100% of their mobile traffic starting with Black Friday and proved its stability running at about 1-2% cpu on 50 servers throughout the highest load. Lasagna graphs flatlines for cpu and memory use</li>\n<li>Walmart starting to replace more of its legacy code with Hapi and even now part of walmart.com</li>\n<li>Hapi has great REST API support as well as infrastructure for building web apps or even serving static content</li>\n<li>Just configure the routes and you are ready, no extra plugins are necessary for the most common functionality</li>\n<li>Liked that Eran provides some quick commentary about features and how they evolved</li>\n<li>Hapi 2.0 isn’t a massive increase in new functionality, in fact it is more about taking out the cruft, eliminating the redundant ways to do things. Names that evolved over time, picking the best and cleaning up the others.</li>\n<li>This strategy shows the wisdom and experience of its architect, to resi the urge to add features by first solidifying the base.</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"routes_caching_state\"></a><h3 id=\"routes-caching-state\">Routes, Caching, State</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Route <code>handler(request, reply)</code> signature changed</li>\n<li><code>server.route({})</code>, can keep routes in one place while config and handler in separate module. validation is configurable, state (cookies)</li>\n<li><code>server.table()</code> gives you the active routing table</li>\n<li>Hapi is a configuration centric framework, set js properties, then it tries to stay out of your way.</li>\n<li>Hapi is written so the meat of your web application can stay pure, you don’t have to deal with the HTTP mechanisms unless you need to for a special case. This leads to clean code which is more focused on your business logic and less on how to deliver via HTTP.</li>\n<li>Helpers can abstract out functionality used in many places like looking up a user profile or users shopping cart</li>\n<li>Caching is changed in 2.0, dropping support for full page caching. You can still configure the client cache headers and expiry but the team removed the page cache since they didn’t want to have a half baked solution, one that didn’t handle all the variety of use cases.</li>\n<li>They still have great support for helper caching which is more straight forward.</li>\n<li>Eran said they will possibly add page caching back in later or I’d expect there to be a basic plugin which provides a basic page cache solving the simple use cases.</li>\n<li>Route prerequesites clean up async handling, can specify arrays for parallel followed by single tasks which are processed serially and any combintion.</li>\n<li><code>handler.bind</code> can be used to share state using object methods</li>\n<li><code>reply().hold()</code>, later calling <code>send()</code> when ready</li>\n<li>Cookie ttl configuration can now be done in a central location cleaninpu up the route config</li>\n<li>Exentensive cookie functionality - automatically encoding in base64 json or even using encryption, hashing, and expiration with Eran’s Iron container</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"plugins\"></a><h3 id=\"plugins\">Plugins</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugins are a cornerstone of Hapi. These differ from something like Express in that plugins are just groupings of server functionality that can be mixed together into servers. You can organize a feature’s functionality, its routes, its configuration, and dependencies. This lives like a normal node.js package and only needs a register method to use with Hapi. These can be developed, versioned separately, mixed in to the server.</li>\n<li>Hapi ensures that once they are all registered that the routes are all valid and nothing conflicts, its a large team’s dream. Easy to test new veerions.</li>\n<li>Plugins can do everything you can do with the server, add routes, helpers, etc.</li>\n<li><code>plugin.composer</code> or command line option to hapi allows you to build a server with simply a package.json and a config.json specifying plugins to use.</li>\n<li>If you couple plugins along with Hapi’s Confidence module you can have one setup which can provide server config for all your various environments.</li>\n<li>The Confidence module provides dynamic configs which can be used for server environments or even runtime use for A/B testing</li>\n<li>Plugin cache is now scoped so its data won’t collide with other plugins</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"authorization\"></a><h3 id=\"authorization\">Authorization</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Authorization is now properly extracted into schemes and strategies, basic auth, hawk, etc. It is much easier to setup authentication and you have options to make authentication required and optional.</li>\n<li>Hapi has defined life cycle extension points at which you can register to have your code called during request life cycle. For instance you could hook in at the beginning of the request, before auth, after auth, before response, etc.</li>\n<li>These extensions can specify dependencies and whether they need to go before or after others.</li>\n<li>One change to how the signature for these extensions is that they now have two params (request and reply) just like handlers. You can call the reply(null) to continue response unchanged. Website docs don’t reflect this yet, so look at the code or tests.</li>\n<li>You can now do additional things for streamed responses in your extensions like set headers as well as peek into the packets being sent back</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"ops\"></a><h3 id=\"ops\">Ops</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New ops functionality<ul>\n<li>Can have server load and memory use logged for easy server health montioring</li>\n<li>Configure max input size, timeouts for client and server</li>\n<li>You can register tail methods which run after a response has been sent</li>\n<li><code>server.inject</code> allows you to use the hapi stack without going through the network stack, great for testing and even for production use if you need to call back in like with OAuth 2.0</li>\n<li>There is now a simulate property for simulating connection close issues</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"postmile_example_app\"></a><h3 id=\"postmile-example-app\">Postmile example app</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>github.com/hueniverse/postmile - large sample app which has been upgraded to Hapi 2.0. It is a collaborative list making tool using hapi 2.0 and Mongo.</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"major_breaking_changes\"></a><h2 id=\"major-breaking-changes\">Major breaking changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>handler(request, reply)</code>, extensions have similar signature</li>\n<li>methods that had many aliases are now simplified like server.route</li>\n<li>page caching removed for now</li>\n<li>route prerequisites now use arrays to designate parallel tasks, and you can mix serial and parallel</li>\n<li>read up on the new auth configuration and mechanisms</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spumko/hapi/issues/1178\">https://github.com/spumko/hapi/issues/1178</a> - github issue with all the Hapi 2.0 breaking changes</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"resources\"></a><h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://hapijs.com\">http://hapijs.com</a> - main site, docs being added for 2.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spumko/hapi\">https://github.com/spumko/hapi</a> - git repo for Hapi</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spumko/hapi/issues/1178\">https://github.com/spumko/hapi/issues/1178</a> - github issue with all the Hapi 2.0 breaking changes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spumko\">https://github.com/spumko</a> - extracted Hapi functionality for use with Hapi or separately</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52139546/hapi%20yet%3F.pdf\">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52139546/hapi%20yet%3F.pdf</a> - hapi-yet-slides with lots of code examples which Eran Hammer used for his live stream</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3u0XkbhleA&amp;t=1461\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3u0XkbhleA&amp;t=1461</a> Eran Hammer Hapi Yet (Hapi 2.0) live stream at &amp;yet, link jumps directly to 24 min where talk starts</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hueniverse/postmile\">https://github.com/hueniverse/postmile</a> Eran Hammer’s sizeable hapi example using many of the Hapi features. Postmile is a collaborative list making tool using hapi 2.0 and mongo.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/poeticninja/hapi-ninja\">https://github.com/poeticninja/hapi-ninja</a> - Saul Maddox’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/poeticninja\" title=\"Saul Maddox twitter\">@poeticninja</a> boilerplate Hapi server example Node.js, Hapi 2.0, Swig templates, Gulp task runner</li>\n<li>Follow <a href=\"http://codewinds.com/\">http://codewinds.com/</a> blog and podcast for continuing coverage</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"summary\"></a><h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>So in summary, Hapi 2.0 is a well thought out release which cleans up and solidifies the codebase while adding some key functionality that can be built on.</p>\n<p> With Walmart putting this framework through the paces and other companies following in its footsteps like the company I am consulting to MasterCard, this framework has evolved with clarity, performance, team usability, and has great deploy and ops support.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Eran and his team have proved that Hapi can handle Black Friday load with ultimate grace, and this new version solidifies its position among Node web frameworks.</p>\n<p>So I encourage you to check out Hapi, and let me know what you think. Head over to codewinds.com and leave me a comment or send me a tweet.</p>",

We also discuss barriers that might prevent us using PE and Aaron makes some useful recommendations. \n\nA much more in-depth discussion of the topic is available in Aaron's book 'Adaptive Web Design: Crafting Rich Experiences with Progressive Enhancement'. \n\nThis week's jukebox picks are definitely going on the Relative Paths Alt Playlist! I started with 'Bambro Koyo Ganda (featuring Innov Gnawa)' by Bonobo. Mark then gave us 'Kick Jump Twist' by Sylvan Esso. Brilliant and needed an immediate second listen. Finally Aaron hit us with post-punk classic 'Teen Age Riot' by Sonic Youth, and a great story.

Chris talked us through it, and it sounds pretty great. We like all the CodePen things.\n\nIt was a diverse Jukebox this week. I chose 'A Tender History In Rust' by Do Say Make Think. Ben chose 'Eve' by Anchorsong, it's very Ben. And Chris chose 'The Stable Song' by Gregory Alan Isakov, and had a very cool story of meeting him IRL.

The Relative Paths Alt Playlist (https://relativepaths.uk/altpl) is also available for your non-coding needs.\n\nSubscribe and keep in touch: \niTunes - https://relativepaths.uk/it\nStitcher - https://relativepaths.uk/st\nSoundCloud - https://relativepaths.uk/sc\nAudioBoom - https://relativepaths.uk/ab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/relativepaths\nFacebook - https://facebook.com/relativepaths\n\nThe music we use for various intro bits, stings and outro is ‘Vitreous Detachment’ by Origamibiro, used with kind permission.\n\n– Mark",

            "description": "This week Ben and I are joined by Front End (or is that Front-End) developer Clive Walker to talk about Perch CMS. We have a lot of positive things to say about it, it's powerful and flexible, but easy to use. We also talk about Perch's many free add-ons, including the recently added Perch Shop e-commerce platform.  Just so you know, we're not being sponsored by Perch, we just really like it. It's become my CMS of choice, and I reckon it's well worth trying out. Clive also tells us about the Perchology newsletter, which contains all sorts of goodies for Perch developers, and the Horsham Co-Working project.\n\nClive's Toolstar is Curated, an app for putting together a digest newsletter, which Clive uses to create the Perchology newsletter.\n\nMy Jukebox choice this time is a solid gold classic, Teardrop by Massive Attack. Clive's pick is Big Calm, the whole album, by Morcheeba (we'll pick a track for the playlist). Ben didn't have a track this week, Bad Ben! Clive and my tracks will be added to the Relative Paths Alt Playlist.\n\nLinks: \nPerch CMS - https://grabaperch.com\nClive's site - https://www.cvwdesign.co.uk\nPerch Shop - https://shop.perchcms.com\nPerchology newsletter - https://perchology.curated.co\nHorsham Coworking - https://www.horshamcoworking.co.uk\nCurated - https://curated.co\nPerch Runway - https://grabaperch.com/products/runway\nPerch Tips & Tricks - http://perchd.io\n\nSubscribe and keep in touch: \niTunes - https://relativepaths.uk/it\nStitcher - https://relativepaths.uk/st\nSoundCloud - https://relativepaths.uk/sc\nAudioBoom - https://relativepaths.uk/ab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/relativepaths\nFacebook - https://facebook.com/relativepaths\n\nThe music we use for various intro bits, stings and outro is ‘Vitreous Detachment’ by Origamibiro, used with kind permission.\n\n– Mark",

I really like it, but Ben might need a bit of time to make friends with it perhaps.\n\nBen's was 'Dirge' by Death in Vegas.

            "description": "http://advancedbeginnerchallenge.com – I built a course to get your first job in web development, or upgrade from Junior to mid-level. All done over email for your convenience.\n\nLearn a framework not a language. The framework is a trojan horse for the knowledge you need of the language.\n\n- Learn Rails, not Ruby.\n- Learn Django, not Python.\n- Learn Angular/Ember/React+Redux, not JavaScript.\n- Learn Phoenix, not Elixir.\n- Learn .NET, not C#.\n- Learn Laravel, not PHP.\n- Etc etc.\n\nA few notes from today's episode:\n\n1. Look around at the industry you want to be in, what are other people spending 80% of their time on, that is only getting them 20% of the result? Hard to identify what exactly that is? If you have trouble with this, just identify what people spend 80% of their time on, and do the opposite. This is what makes people massively successful, mark my words.\n\n2. SKIP OVER what you identified in #1. SKIP OVER what most people are doing. This is taking MASSIVE ACTION. Massive action is relative. Relative to the rest of humans on this planet, are you taking massive action? \n\nHere are some examples of taking massive action:\n\n- Learn a Framework: Deploy ANYTHING to Heroku (that only you will see) by tomorrow. No excuses.\n\n- Learn a Framework: complete 1 page that has some functionality you agree with yourself ahead of time, deploy it to Heroku, then send to 2 friends on Facebook and ask them to try and use it. \n\n- Go start interviewing for jobs, NOW. WHY WAIT? Stop sitting around and take action. \n\n- Want to start a podcast? Launch a crappy first version by TOMORROW. \n\n- Want to write a book? Launch a crappy first eBook by next Monday. No matter what.\n\nStop trying to make everything perfect on the first try, just focus on making stuff good on the second try. \n\nYour first handful of job interviews, book chapters, podcast episodes, programming projects - they will all SUCK on the first go around. BE OKAY WITH THAT and push forward and keep going and you will advance beyond the crowd. Most people either A) get obsessed with making the first version perfect and never go anywhere, or B) feel so depressed from their first version being a failure they never go anywhere. SKIP OVER ALL THAT, and get somewhere. \n\nOr don't, and continue to take small actions, and remain in limbo for the rest of your life. \n\nThis is my challenge for you. Are you up for it? Tweet me @dainmiller and let me know you are taking massive actions. Ask me questions on the best massive action to take. I will hold you accountable. You aren't allowed to do small things if you are following me. I will make sure you are accountable. Go to twitter and follow me and let's do this.",

We quiz Mark about his leap from 'sole-trading freelancer' to the founder of Limited company 'Highrise Digital'. Mark W provides lots of useful information for anyone considering a similar move: financial matters, VAT, partnering up, and employees.\n\nMark W's picked the Toolstar, and chose QuickCast, a simple to use screencasting app, providing easy recording, publishing and sharing.\nhttps://quickcast.io/\n \nFor the Relative Paths Playlist, my submission is 'Eating Hooks' (instrumental) by Moderat.  It comes from the instrumental version of their 2016 Album 'III'. \n\nMark's track is called 'Try the Bass' by Ronald Jenkees. It's nuts.

Gather Context! Read 10 tutorials in your framework & language. 10 is a lot. If you don't know what I mean by this, I recorded an entire portion of an episode on this topic here: http://starthere.fm/webdev/one.\n\n3. Reps and sets: Do 10-25 tutorials. can you do it?\n\n4. BONUS: find mentor to ask questions on ur journey :) twitter is great for this, check out my podcast on networking on twitter here: http://starthere.fm/general/28-how-to-network-and-stay-in-your-comfort-zone-step-by-step-guide-to-networking-for-introverts\n\n4. Project Phase\nA. Learn a version control system & setup git project\nB. Find project online that u suspect uses ur framework and language\nC. Pull out paper and do a \"low fidelity\" mockup of the website that you are seeing.\nD. get basic application up and running by following tutorial \"How to build a blog in FRAMEWORK/LANGUAGE HERE\"\nE. break your mockups into \"sections\" that are tutorials you might find online, then combine the tutorials together into an app\n\n5. BONUS: Ask mentor any questions you might have at this phase\nAttempt to develop relationship with mentor\n\n6. Pre-job last educational push (courses, coaches, further professional development, etc). Modeling a person is a great thing to do in this phase. Find a course or program or person that you can model or learn from in this phase.\n\n7. You're ready to start looking for a job.\n\nPlease hit the like button if you listen to this podcast!

For this one guys, there are like 40 options on Amazon. So what you want to do is find a book called \"Discreet Mathematics and Its Applications\". Unfortunately though some versions of this book cost $240 USD, but the good news is some only cost 40 cents. So it varies wildly, and really you can select any version at whatever price you can afford. Here is a direct amazon link to the search result where you can select from the price point you can afford. http://bit.ly/search-for-discrete-text-on-amazon\n- Analysis of Algorithms. For this one, I recommend this book http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1463417791&sr=8-3&keywords=analysis+of+algorithms which is about $60 USD.

The author provides additional resources some of which you can purchase. We don't believe you need to pay for an education in web development so bypass those resources. In step 2 we'd ask you to skip the Build Your First Website section. Our second resource provides a more thorough lesson.\n\n- Work through Lesson 1, Building Your First Web Page, from learn.shayhowe.com\n\nShay's lesson is a crash course and a fantastic introduction to HTML and CSS. Technically, it's a lesson about building for the front-end but we think every web developer should know these things.\n\n- Talk to Us\n\nPlease tell us why you want to be a web developer.

            "description": "This week we're pleased to be joined by the hosts of the Net Award nominated CTRL+CLICK CAST podcast (http://ctrlclickcast.com/), Emily Lewis and Lea Alcantara. We talk about CMS's and especially whether, despite its popularity, we should look beyond WordPress to other platforms.\n\nMy ToolStar this week is World Community Grid (https://secure.worldcommunitygrid.org/). An application which had enabled over 650 000 people and 470 organisations to donate spare computer power to help make ground breaking scientific discoveries in\ncancer treatment, clean energy, tropical diseases, AIDS and many other fields..\n\nThis week's Jukebox track is: 'Murmuration' by GoGo Penguin, added to the growing Relative Paths Playlist (http://relativepaths.uk/playlist). Lea and Emily didn't add a track to the playlist, but they drew our attention to the fantastic game music remixes at Overclocked Remix.\n\nLea chose our read of the week, 'The Principles of Performance by Design' by Eric W. Mobley, which discusses the importance of prioritising site performance. Lea also mentioned '15 Years Ago in ALA: Much Ado About 5K' by Jeffrey Zeldman, well worth a read (http://alistapart.com/blog/post/fifteen-years-ago-in-ala-much-ado-about-5k).\n\nThe music we use for various intro bits, stings and outro is 'Vitreous Detachment' by Origamibiro, used with kind permission.\n\nIf you like the show, please leave a review or comment wherever you like to listen to us. We'd particularly love an iTunes review.\n\n- Mark\n\n\nVote for CTRL+CLICK CAST in the Net Awards best podcast of the year category (https://thenetawards.com/vote/podcast/ctrl-click-cast/)",

This week we couldn't find a web professional to interview, so I'll talk about one I enjoyed instead! \n\nMy ToolStar is 'WP Performance Profiler' by Interconnect IT. It's a very handy WordPress plugin to tell you exactly what's happening with memory usage and DB queries on your site.\n(https://wpperformanceprofiler.interconnectit.com)\n\nMark's Read of the Week is 'Just Try and Do a Good Job' (https://css-tricks.com/just-try-and-do-a-good-job)in which Chris Coyier extols the virtues of not being too dogmatic when layout out CSS. There's also a bonus linked article from Harry Roberts called 'The Specificity Graph'.\n\nTopping-up the Jukebox this week we have:\n– 'Switchcraft' by Chilly Gonzales, picked by Mark. \n– 'Nepalese Bliss' by The Irresistible Force, chosen by me.\nPlaylist: http://relativepaths.uk/playlist\n\nThe music we use for various intro bits, stings and outro is 'Vitreous Detachment' by Origamibiro, used with kind permission.\n\n- Ben\n\nSubscribe and keep in touch\n  iTunes - http://relativepaths.uk/it\n  Stitcher - http://relativepaths.uk/st\n  SoundCloud - http://relativepaths.uk/sc\n  Twitter - http://twitter.com/relativepaths\n  Facebook - http://facebook.com/relativepaths\n\nIf you like the show, please leave a review or comment wherever you like to listen to us.

            "description": "This week Ben and I record a special episode for Geek Mental Help Week. We talk a bit about its origins and what's happening throughout the week, but we mostly talk about our own experiences with depression and how we handled it. We also suggest some ways you can help yourself if you're suffering from depression and how you can help a sufferer. We're not medical professionals, but we hope that our experiences might be useful. If you'd like to get involved go and take a look at: http://geekmentalhelp.com\n\nFor our regular dukebox slot Ben has chosen 'Cotton Wool (Fila Brazillia mix)' by Lamb. My choice is 'Happiness' by Jonsi & Alex.\n\nThe intro and outro music we use is 'Vitreous Detachment' by Origamibiro, used with their very kind permission.\n\n– Mark\n\nSubscribe and keep in touch\n  iTunes - http://relativepaths.uk/it\n  Stitcher - http://relativepaths.uk/st\n  SoundCloud - http://relativepaths.uk/sc\n  Twitter - http://twitter.com/relativepaths\n  Facebook - http://facebook.com/relativepaths\n\nIf you like the show, please leave a review or comment wherever you like to listen to us.

Graphic design is a powerful tool for imprinting that definition. Here’s how our graphic design team can help you send a focused, memorable brand message.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>We keep sound marketing concepts foremost in our minds.</strong> Each team member receives ongoing marketing training. This helps us create your design from a marketing perspective. We don’t just create pretty graphics; we create graphics that sell products.</li>\r\n<li><strong>We create reference documents that identify your unique message.</strong> We record your target market, primary value points and promotional channels. Throughout your project, we refer back to these documents to ensure we create graphics that are consistent with your written message.</li>\r\n<li><strong>We emphasize your product’s special qualities.</strong> Consumers receive countless messages throughout the day. To help people remember your product’s advantages, we highlight them repeatedly. And we make it clear what product or service you’re promoting.</li>\r\n<li><strong>We consider how the communication process really works.</strong> Individual consumers interpret information differently. We ask ourselves: For the target consumer to receive the intended message, how does information need to be presented? We carefully plan how to communicate your message visually.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Graphic design can be more influencing than copy. It needs to pair nicely with your content. If consumers receive conflicting messages, they may be confused about what you offer. When you ask us to create graphic design, you receive more than images; you receive good marketing.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to send a strong, consistent brand message, call me at 952-697-5211 or complete our <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/contact-2/\" target=\"_blank\">form</a>. I’ll ask you about your product and how you’re currently promoting it. We’ll meet to plan a strategy. Then we’ll put it into action.</p>\r\n<p>Our end goal is to help you raise awareness and drive sales. All of our efforts will be geared towards this.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheCheckerboardPodcast/~4/_--xwDiXpq8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

And I’m also a marketer. Everyone here at Media Relations Agency is well versed in marketing techniques and philosophies. It’s part of our culture. Each and every staff member, regardless of our title or job duties, has to understand marketing principles. Yes, there’s even a test. This common knowledge is one reason why our clients enjoy working with us. We don’t just create content that sounds pleasing. We make graphics which help tell their stories beautifully.</p>\r\n<p>I’m a fairly new graphic designer, but I already feel miles ahead of my peers because of this continuing education. Let me explain one way this knowledge makes our design team more strategic than your average freelance graphic designer.</p>\r\n<p>Before starting on the project, we consider the communication process.</p>\r\n<p>People’s unique ideas and experiences can affect how they perceive a message. For example, college students may think the word “inexpensive” means “affordable”, while wealthy executives may infer that “inexpensive” means “flimsy”. As designers, we anticipate how the receiver will decode our graphics. To a college student, a child in a graphic may make them think of younger siblings or being a carefree kid again.  An older executive may think of grandchildren and leaving a legacy.</p>\r\n<p>A good image helps each viewer decode a message in exactly the way we intend. One example is Checkerboard’s Responsive Web Design page. This page features images of client work on different devices to help demonstrate what responsive design means. We use these rotating images to help the viewer, most likely someone interested in our services, decode the message clearly. The images help the viewer envision their own website improvements. Regardless of their grasp of web design lingo – and whether or not they even read the accompanying text – they now know we create websites that look amazing on any screen.</p>\r\n<p>People process visuals much faster than they process text. It’s critical that graphics get attention and help tell the right story. You can’t afford to have a graphic that detracts from your messaging which is why your next graphic designer needs to have marketing chops.</p>\r\n<p>Try us out on a project.

You’ll see that our team delivers graphics that are a cut above the rest.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheCheckerboardPodcast/~4/ja-azzD8es4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

They may know far more about your product, and your competitor’s product, than you think. They’re actively researching your product online. They’re sharing opinions of brands on social media. This information helps them decide to buy – or not to buy – your product. Listening to your customers’ online conversations can help you better market your product, but too few companies take advantage of this critical data. They’re missing out on a goldmine of information and opportunities to boost sales.</p>\r\n<p><strong>We’re all online these days</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We’re a digital society. Nearly 9 in 10 American adults use the internet. About 70 percent seek out reviews before making a purchase.</li>\r\n<li>We’re social. Nearly two-thirds of American adults use social media sites<sup>1</sup>. Facebook is the most popular social media, adding six new profiles every second. But don’t discount Twitter or Instagram. There are 500 million tweets sent each day and over four billion Instagram likes daily.</li>\r\n<li>Businesses also see the benefit of social media. Ninety-one percent of retail brands use two or more social media channels<sup>2</sup>. And Forbes reports that businesses are spending more of their advertising budget on social media channels than ever before<sup>3</sup>. Yet many businesses aren’t seeing the impact. Why?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Too many companies do all the talking and not enough listening</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many brands’ Facebook and Twitter feeds are loaded with messages about why you should buy their products. Many consumers’ social feeds are filled with sponsored posts from companies touting their latest sales. What’s missing is the interaction. Too few companies actually engage with their customers on social media.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Social listening gives you the information you need to create meaningful and engaging content.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Social listening gives you unparalleled market insight into your customers’ thoughts, feeling and actions. It tells you which messages are being shared and which are being ignored. It’s the catalyst for high-performing content creation which drives engagement. It also keeps you ahead of your competition.</p>\r\n<p>And best of all, it provides peace of mind. When the data shows that your messages are being read and shared, you know you’re on the right marketing track.</p>\r\n<p>Social media listening gives you the insights you need to reach and teach your customers … and convince them to buy from you.

Good for you. Now comes the hard part. Building a website takes a lot of expertise – both technical and marketing – and thoughtful consideration. At Checkerboard, we can’t stop thinking about your website. We ask a lot of questions prior to the design and build. And then we continue thinking about your website even after it’s completed. Our continuous analysis process helps make the website-building process easier for you, as well as for us.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Questions we ask you</strong></p>\r\n<p>Every website builder has a list of questions they ask new clients. Checkerboard’s list of questions, however, goes beyond the basics. Here are a few of the questions we may ask:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Who is responsible for the content for your website?</li>\r\n<li>How does your company make most of your revenue?</li>\r\n<li>Which profit areas do you want to grow?</li>\r\n<li>Who are your customers, and why do they purchase from you?</li>\r\n<li>Who is the main decision maker in this web-build process?</li>\r\n<li>How will this website integrate with your other marketing channels?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>We also question ourselves</strong></p>\r\n<p>After every build, we get the entire Checkerboard team together to analyze your site and the build process. We question ourselves: What went right? What was a challenge? What did we learn? Some agencies may consider a meeting on a completed project a waste of resources. Others may understand its importance but not consistently follow through. But this step is critical for us. It’s a non-negotiable part of our process. Why? Because it prepares us for the next build.</p>\r\n<p>We want each project to be completed on time, on budget and to be pain-free for our clients and our team. One way I ensure this is by reviewing our list of risks and previous challenges prior to each build. This information (stored in one of my beautiful Excel spreadsheets) prepares our team for any issues that may come up. It also helps us ask the right questions prior to getting started. This saves our clients’ time, resources and stress.</p>\r\n<p>Put our team of thinkers to action. Get started by giving us a call at 952-697-5211 or <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/start/\" target=\"_blank\">requesting a free consultation</a>. It’s a great opportunity for us to get to know each other. And chances are, we’ll ask you a few questions you haven’t heard from those other guys.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheCheckerboardPodcast/~4/rMfsXlF--u4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

They know your product and industry better than anyone! If you could just share some of what’s in their heads with the right prospects, you know sales would increase. That’s why white papers matter. They put high-value content in the right hands, and you capture more quality leads.</p>\r\n<p>Media Relations’ writers can help organize your team’s ideas and get them in writing. Our writers have written for more than 70 different industries. We can write clearly and intelligently about your industry as well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>White papers make ideal gated content</strong></p>\r\n<p>Gated content is anything that requires someone to supply information, such as their name and email address, before they can read, download or interact with it. Gated content is most often created for lead generation. It converts your anonymous web visitors into known contacts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Our Media-Grade Content<sup>&#174;</sup> will start conversations</strong></p>\r\n<p>Think of white papers as ice breakers. You’ll get the reader’s contact information and you’ll know what interests them. To get the most from your white paper:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Tackle an issue that is common within your primary target market.</strong> Provide must-read information by addressing topics that concern decision makers. Our Media-Grade Content will help ensure that you educate readers and prompt a desire to know more. And what exactly is “Media-Grade Content”? “Media-Grade Content” is your assurance that everything we write is interesting, substantive, worthy of your audience’s time, and relevant to their lives.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Know where your ideal prospects are within the consumer buying process.</strong> Do you want to reach people who are just beginning to identify their needs or are you targeting people who are well into evaluating their options? Meet people where they are, and provide factual tipping points in your favor.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Avoid heavily promotional content.</strong> Use your white paper to establish your credibility as a trusted industry expert.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A white paper doesn’t have to be long or complicated. It just needs to be informative, well written and persuasive. It needs to clearly communicate your knowledge on a subject of interest to your primary market.

            "description": "<p>The following audio is from a blog post and video in our Marketing-to-Go series. <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/marketingtogo/why-isnt-your-marketing-working/\" target=\"_blank\">Marketing-to-Go: Why Isn’t Your Marketing Working?</a></p>\r\n<p>It’s a common problem. A business invests heavily in marketing, but then doesn’t get the results they expect. It leaves many marketers perplexed. Hmmm, my product is great. Why aren’t people buying it?</p>\r\n<p>The sad truth is many marketers are promoting their product all wrong. They place ad after ad, but get little in return. They may end up wasting a bunch of money and looking like failures. They may blame the economy, or the product itself. But that’s not really the problem.</p>\r\n<p>The issue: Their simple ads don’t fulfill the needs of the consumer.</p>\r\n<p>Smart marketers need to address each stage in the consumer buying process. Here are the process steps:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Needs recognition.</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Information search.</strong> Today’s consumers crave information, and they have easy access to it via their smartphones, tablets and laptops.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Evaluation of alternatives.</strong> Now the consumer narrows down their list and weighs the pro’s and con’s of each.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Purchase decision.</strong> The moment of truth. The consumer makes a choice.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Post-purchase behavior.</strong> Call this the “aftermath”. Is the consumer happy with their decision, or do they regret not getting a different model?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Let me give you an example. Let’s say a consumer’s toaster is working fine until the power cord shorts out. They now need a different toaster to toast their bagels! Many companies make toasters. The consumer goes online and checks toaster ratings, options, and reviews. Would the four-slot toaster be preferable to the two-slot toaster? Which brand? How about toaster ovens? The consumer decides to go with a two-slot toaster with a five-star consumer rating. Is the consumer happy with this two-slot toaster, or do they regret not being able to toast twice as much?</p>\r\n<p>A good marketer considers all stages of the consumer buying process. They use solid search strategy, smart content, and strategic advertising to engage and attract prospects and drive sales. It’s integrated marketing that leads the consumer through the buying process, from needs recognition to purchase to satisfied and ready to buy again.</p>\r\n<p>Hungry for more?

If only people knew about it, they would buy it.</p>\r\n<p>That’s often true.</p>\r\n<p>What else is often true is that many marketers are promoting their new products all wrong.</p>\r\n<p>They act as if they’re marketing an established product and not an up-and-coming one. They use the same tactics as those iconic brands, such as Coca-Cola or McDonalds, but then they come up short.</p>\r\n<p>What do I tell them?  You have to consider the product’s lifecycle stage when you create your promotions.</p>\r\n<p>The Product Lifecycle is the period of time a product exists in the marketplace, from its introduction to its discontinuation. It consists of four stages:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Introductory</li>\r\n<li>Growth</li>\r\n<li>Maturity</li>\r\n<li>Declining</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Not all products go through each stage. Some decline soon after introduction. Some remain in the maturity phase for long periods. The period of time in each phase can vary greatly.</p>\r\n<p>But what doesn’t vary is HOW you should promote a product when it’s in those early stages. The first two stages need heavy promotion. You must use Reach and Teach marketing. Use Reach and Remind in the latter phases, but today, we’re focusing on NEW products.</p>\r\n<p>Your focus should be on educating consumers about the product:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How it solves a problem</li>\r\n<li>What it can do and, most importantly</li>\r\n<li>Why they need it</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The key is to obtain enough exposure to adequately explain the product and to share your message in a format that consumers will actually listen to and trust. This will create the desire to buy!</p>\r\n<p>So how do you do that?</p>\r\n<p>You need articles in magazines and newspapers, interviews on television and radio as well as plenty of content online. This publicity can provide enough bandwidth for an adequate explanation about your product. Best of all, today’s consumers are very receptive to hearing your messaging delivered through these channels. In fact, they’re craving it.</p>\r\n<p>What shouldn’t you do?</p>\r\n<p>You can’t depend on traditional advertising to sell your product. First of all, buying enough ads to explain all but the most basic product will probably bust your budget. And second, today’s consumers tend to be “ad-blind”. We all simply dismiss ads without reading them. We just don’t trust them. But read about a new product in the newspaper ... See it on the morning news ... Hear an expert discuss its benefits on the radio … then see it mentioned in an online article. Now you peaked the consumer’s interest … and opened their wallet.</p>\r\n<p>Ready for more? <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/category/marketingtogo/\" target=\"_blank\">Watch our videos</a> for more tips that you can put to use immediately. <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/sign-up-for-newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\">Be sure to subscribe!</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheCheckerboardPodcast/~4/BiPrdEyVzTo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

            "description": "<p>The following audio is from a blog post and video in our Marketing-to-Go series. <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/marketingtogo/marketing-go-can-get-people-buy-product/\" target=\"_blank\">Marketing to Go: How Can You Get People to Buy Your New Product?</a></p>\r\n<p>Having a great product can go a long way, but unless you’re an established company or have an unlimited marketing budget, you may find it a challenge to get your product into people’s hands. I’ve helped hundreds of companies boost their product sales through strategic marketing.</p>\r\n<p>My secret: Sending the right message to the right people at the right time.</p>\r\n<p>Let me tell you a story:</p>\r\n<p>In the 1930s, Everett Rogers was just a young boy on his father’s Iowa farm. At the time, the surrounding farms were all adopting a new drought-resistant seed corn. His father, however, resisted this technology.</p>\r\n<p>When a drought came, his father’s crops died. But his neighbor’s crops all stood tall. It was then that Roger’s father decided he should start using these new seeds.</p>\r\n<p>Fast forward 30 years and Rogers is now a Sociology professor of  at Ohio State University. This experience on his father’s farm inspires him to develop the innovation adoption curve. This is the theory that describes how and when the public adopts new products. It’s critical information that every marketer needs to consider when promoting their new product.</p>\r\n<p>Rogers split consumers into five groups based on their tendency to try a new product. Here’s the gist:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>The Innovators</strong> – These are the people that camp outside electronic stores to get the latest tech products. This group wants the newest thing and they want it now -- and they don’t mind paying extra for this opportunity.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The Early adopters</strong> – This group closely watches the innovators and picks up new trends from them. Like the innovators, they constantly seek new innovations and experiences. But unlike the innovators, they don’t try every innovation that comes their way.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The Early majority</strong> – This group also watches the group before them. They think, “I see a lot of people using this, maybe I should give it a try.” But, they are also more loyal to the products they use.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Late majority</strong> – This group will only adopt a product once they see it being used by everyone else. They’re slow to adapt to change, but they are very loyal to the products they use.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Laggards</strong> – This is that friend who still reaches for the phone book when they want to find a phone number. This group resists change at all costs.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>So what does this mean for marketers? Quite simply, you can’t take a one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to your marketing. You need to have a rich understanding of <em>who</em> you should be trying to reach, as well as <em>which messages</em> will resonate with them, and <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> to use them. A “new” product may be appealing to some, but it was a turn-off to Roger’s father. He’d prefer a product “trusted by thousands”, but that term would not appeal to innovators. Good marketers know how to adjust their sales content to target the right audience for their product.</p>\r\n<p>Writing marketing content isn't easy. There's a lot to consider, from the Innovation Adoption Curve to the Product Lifecycle.

            "description": "<p>The following audio is from a blog post and video in our Marketing-to-Go series. <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/marketingtogo/include-new-business-website/\" target=\"_blank\">Marketing to Go: What Should I Include in My New Business Website?</a></p>\r\n<p>Your website can make or break your business. Eighty percent of people look at a business’ website at some point in the buying process. I consider it your most important salesperson. So it’s critically important that your website has what it takes to bring people through your sales funnel, from discovery to information-gathering to action. I’ll explain what you need to include on your website. Truth be told, this piece has potential to make or break your business.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s get started.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. A smart website is easy to use.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Your customers need to easily navigate through your website, regardless of the device they are using.  Make it obvious where your visitors should go to find information.  And, don’t bury your most valuable and requested information!  It should be one simple click away from your homepage.</p>\r\n<p>Help your customers take the next step in the buying process, whether that is signing up for your newsletter or making a purchase. Provide multiple conversion opportunities. For example, include a newsletter sign-up form or a link to your online store on every page.</p>\r\n<p>A website needs to be easy for you to use, too. At Checkerboard, we build our websites on WordPress engines because they are powerful, flexible and so user friendly. Plus WordPress integrates with other marketing tools, such as email and social media. This saves our customers time, effort and money.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. A smart website contains the right content.</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is where some websites miss the mark. In addition to the basics about your product — what is where, where to buy it, etc — a smart website needs to clearly identify your product positioning.</p>\r\n<p><em>Positioning refers to developing the difference between your product and the competition’s product in the thoughts of consumers.</em></p>\r\n<p>Chances are, you don’t have a one-of-a-kind product. So why should customers choose your product over your competitor’s? That’s where positioning comes in. Positioning tells your consumers where your product fits into the market. Is it the highest quality? Lowest price? Closest to the beach? What makes it unique?</p>\r\n<p>Some factors that you may want to consider include:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Price</li>\r\n<li>Quality</li>\r\n<li>Speed of delivery</li>\r\n<li>Convenience</li>\r\n<li>Location</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>What’s important is that you clearly communicate your positioning through written content and design.</p>\r\n<p>That brings us to number 3.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. A smart website must be well-designed</strong></p>\r\n<p>Some business owners and web designers focus too much on the visuals. They give the website all kinds of bells and whistles to dazzle the viewer. Don’t fall into this trap. While design is critical, what’s more important is that your website actually drives sales.</p>\r\n<p>But don’t ignore design either! Poor design detracts from your message, and can even turn away a customer. Remember, you have just seconds to catch a visitor’s attention. Make them count!</p>\r\n<p>Good designers use your positioning statement to develop your design. This way, their visuals add to the user experience.  This helps your customers better understand your story and take action. The best designers combine technical skills with marketing know-how to create a website that functions as well as it looks.</p>\r\n<p>When you build smart — your website helps visitors take action. And isn’t that what you want from a website?</p>\r\n<p>Ready for more? <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/category/marketingtogo/\" target=\"_blank\">Watch our videos</a> for more tips that you can put to use immediately. <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/sign-up-for-newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\">Be sure to subscribe!</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheCheckerboardPodcast/~4/7Jp7RjoCc1M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Today’s consumers go online to find answers. If your website is filled with outdated information, doesn’t answer their questions or worse – can’t be found – it won’t solve their problem. And you won’t make the sale.</p>\r\n<p>Keep your website working for you by making sure it fills your customers’ desires.</p>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Does it function well on mobile phones, tablets and desktops?</strong> Many businesses have found that visits from tablet and smart phone users have nearly doubled over the past year.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Does the content fill your customers’ needs?</strong> Do you know which content is most read? What pages get skipped over quickly? This data helps you keep your website current.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Are new customers finding you on search engines and through digital ads?</strong> Your website can’t produce sales if customers can’t find it. Savvy marketers follow current SEO strategies and make smart, cost-effective use of digital ads.</li></ul>\r\n<p>This may seem overwhelming. Many areas of your business need your attention. How do you find the time to stay up to date on digital best practices and monitor your website analytics? This is why a professional digital marketing assistant is so valuable.</p>\r\n<p>A digital marketing assistant keeps your website current and customer-focused. If you sell jewelry at a retail store, you notice when your customers begin crowding around the chunky necklaces display and walking past the charm bracelets. You probably make adjustments, such as moving the trendy necklaces to a prominent store location.</p>\r\n<p>Digital marketing assistants are just as attuned with your website and can make similar changes. They know what content results in sales and make sure it’s easy to find. They also know what’s not working, and provide advice to make it better.</p>\r\n<p>An employee doing double-duty updating your website is definitely helpful, but they probably don’t have the experience of our digital marketing assistants. Our team lives and breathes websites. They know industry best practices. They stay informed of trends and search engine algorithm changes. They’re also experts at digital advertising and can use this tactic to cost-effectively bring customers to your door, whether it’s virtual or brick-and-mortar.</p>\r\n<p>Put our team to work for you by calling at 952-697-5211 or <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/start/\" target=\"_blank\">requesting a free consultation</a>.

It’s more than just a trend. It’s just may be the future of marketing. If you’re not already using video on your website and social media channels, it’s time to get started. Here’s why:</p>\r\n<ol><li><p><strong>Video can get you in front of a massive audience</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to Pew Research Center, 78 percent of adults watch or download online video<sup>1</sup>. That figure has more than doubled over the past 10 years. And it’s projected to keep growing. You need to tell your story the way your customers want to consume it. For many products, that means a video posted on YouTube (the internet’s second largest search engine) and shared through other channels.</p></li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Video keeps consumers glued to your website</strong></p>\r\n<p>When a potential customer arrives at your website, the right video can grab and hold their attention. This study found that video can double the amount of time users spend on a site<sup>2</sup>. Couple this “stickiness” with well-written website content and strong design, and you may gain a boost in your search engine ranking, better informed customers and ultimately more sales.</p></li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Videos build credibility</strong></p>\r\n<p>Today’s consumers want to know who they’re buying from. A video can share your company’s story as well as the people in it. This builds consumers’ trust in your business and product. One caveat: Videos only build credibility when they look professional. That’s why we produce our videos in our professional facility with high-quality equipment.</p></li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Videos receive more interaction on social media</strong></p>\r\n<p>There’s a reason why all the top publishers on Facebook are posting more videos: It works<sup>3</sup>. The average amount of shares of video posts has doubled between August 2015 and July 2016. This makes videos even more likely than still images to appear on more people’s newsfeeds.</p></li></ol>\r\n<p>We make it easy to include video in digital marketing.

You’re on top of seasonal trends and upcoming challenges as well as your competition. And of course you understand your products better than anyone else. With all that swimming around in your head, I realize you may not be following the latest social media trends. Thankfully, we have a team here that does!</p><p>Here’s what you need to know to make the most of this ever-changing promotional platform.</p><p><strong>Number One: It’s all about stories.</strong></p><p>Facebook recently introduced Facebook Stories for its mobile users. It’s nearly identical to Instagram Stories which debuted last August. Both use the format made famous by Snapchat: personal videos or photos (and of course, filters) which disappear after 24 hours. Similar to Instagram, Facebook stories appear on the top of your news feed. Keep in mind that Facebook has a much broader audience, so many of its users may be unfamiliar with this communication style. That doesn’t mean you should ignore this trend. It’s a smart way to share a limited-time offer on your personal account (Stories aren’t available for business pages yet) without overpopulating your page with promotional posts.</p><p><strong>Number Two: Social posts have a small window of opportunity.</strong></p><p>The lifespan of a social post is probably shorter than you think. The majority of Facebook engagement occurs within the first few hours after your post. And a Tweet gets cold in less than 20 minutes. Chances are, you’re not posting enough. We suggest most businesses increase their number of weekly posts to reach a greater percentage of their audiences. According to LinkedIn<sup>1</sup>, you need 20 posts per month to reach 60 percent of your audience.</p><p><strong>Number Three: Personal sharing is down.</strong></p><p>Your Facebook page looks different than it did a few years ago. Fewer people are posting personal updates<sup>2</sup>. Instead, Facebook users are sharing links and stories they find on other websites. While this makes it harder to stay connected with your high school friends, it makes it easier to market your business. Make sure you are creating plenty of content that can be shared by your followers. Pro tip: The lifespan of these blogs, graphics or videos is much longer than a simple post – think months rather than minutes – so invest in quality content that has a viral bent.</p><p><strong>Number Four: Mobile is driving the bus.</strong></p><p>It’s clear that most consumers are using their mobile phones to access social media. We see it in our clients’ analytics and in every data nugget revealed, such as Facebook announcing it now has more than one billion mobile users<sup>3</sup>.  Some data indicate that nearly 80 percent of all social media time is spent on mobile devices. So what does that mean for marketers? You better make sure that the action you want your followers to take is mobile-friendly. Nix any long forms and make sure your website is device-agnostic.</p><p>Keeping up with social media can be a challenge. You may not have the time to give it the attention it deserves. You also may not be willing to hand it over to someone else. I have a suggestion. Meet with me and my social media team. We’ll work together to develop a no-nonsense strategy and implementation plan.

If a company doesn’t categorize its products and consider its product mix, confusion can result. Having a methodical system of organizing products is much more efficient and easier to work with. In addition, once a company has organized its product mix and come up with a written system of categorization for its products, this categorization can be used across the company.</p>\r\n<p>A product mix table can provide a nice overview and also identify opportunities as well as problems. For example, a chain of trendy women’s clothing stores may offer a huge variety of merchandise to its customers. The people who manage the chain’s new offerings need to keep track of all the merchandise by category, to make sure that each season they offer casual clothing, professional clothing, activewear and accessories. If management assembles a product mix table for the new season and notices that there are no new activewear styles, they can put more effort into that area.</p>\r\n<p>Ready for more? <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/category/marketingtogo/\" target=\"_blank\">Watch our videos</a> for more tips that you can put to use immediately. <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/sign-up-for-newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\">Be sure to subscribe!</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheCheckerboardPodcast/~4/IK_VYUghNWQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Market Segmentation Variables are characteristics you can use to build that customer profile or persona. Begin by thinking of your customer as a stick person. From there, add characteristics until you build a comprehensive individual.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some of elements you can use:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Demographics</strong><br />\r\nThese include age, gender, income, ethnicity, or family life cycle.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Geographics</strong><br />\r\nThese can include a geographic location such as a city, state or region.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Psychographics</strong><br />\r\nThese are how people think, such as rock stars thinking differently than librarians.</p>  \r\n<p><strong>Geodemographics</strong><br />\r\nThis category combines the psychographic and geographic categories. For example, New York business people think differently than Montana ranchers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Benefit Sought</strong><br />\r\nSuch as low price, high quality, quick delivery or best color.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Usage Rate</strong><br />\r\nIs your consumer a frequent buyer, one-time buyer, sporadic buyer, or possibly a moderate buyer?</p>\r\n<p>You can also use Market Segmentation Variables to create compelling examples in your marketing. For example, if you determine the average age of your typical customer and know whether your product appeals more to a male or female, you can research common names for people of that age and gender. Using those names will help you build believable characters with whom your customers in that market segment can more easily identify. Moms who were born in the late 1970s may identify with other women named Amy or Jennifer, whereas their grandmothers may relate to women named Estelle or Dorothy.</p>\r\n<p>Ready for more? <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/category/marketingtogo/\" target=\"_blank\">Watch our videos</a> for more tips that you can put to use immediately. <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/sign-up-for-newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\">Be sure to subscribe!</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheCheckerboardPodcast/~4/GKTLdKidNk0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Y’know pizza is a pretty cool thing. Not only is it delicious, but it’s also very versatile. For instance, if i’m sharing a pizza with a vegetarian, I can get meat on my section and only veggies on theirs. Or to take it further, I could split up this pizza into many smaller slices each with their own toppings so that each piece would appeal to a smaller set of people. What I’ve described here is actually very similar to a marketing concept called Market Segmentation. Let’s talk about that!</p>\r\n<p>So, marketers sometimes divide their audience into similar groups called submarkets. But how many submarkets should you market to? Three? Eight? Fifty? None at all?</p>\r\n<p>Let’s review the four basic Marketing Segmentation Strategies.</p>\r\n<ul><li>Undifferentiated</li>\r\n<li>Concentrated</li>\r\n<li>Multi-segmented</li>\r\n<li>Micro-segmented</li></ul>\r\n<p><strong>First, the undifferentiated strategy.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The undifferentiated strategy means that there is no market segmentation. The entire market is treated as one group. Everyone in your market gets the same message, or with the pizza example - the same toppings. Your promotions treat your entire market as one persona.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Concentrated strategy.</strong></p>\r\n<p>With a concentrated segmentation strategy, you isolate one, two or three primary market segments that have the most potential value. It’s like only offering three types of toppings for your pizza, appealing to three types of people.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Next, the multi-segmented strategy.</strong></p>\r\n<p>A multi-segmented strategy creates separate marketing messages for four or more different market segments. Now we’re adding more toppings to appeal to even more people.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Finally, a micro-segmented.</strong></p>\r\n<p>A micro-segmented strategy targets marketing to a very small group of people, perhaps even all the way down to the individual level. This is like offering so many different slices of pizza that have various topping changes, like anchovies and black olives or blue cheese and hamburger meat, slices that probably only a few people have an appetite for but we want to appeal to them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p>The market segmentation strategy that is right for you depends entirely on the needs of your organization and product. The best strategy for one company may not be good for another company. Choosing a segmentation strategy, however, will help give you the discipline to commit your resources to the most valuable market segments.</p>\r\n<p>Now that you now about market segmentation, I’m about to segment this pizza into my mouth. Mmm … segmentation…</p>\r\n<p>Ready for more? <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/category/marketingtogo/\" target=\"_blank\">Watch our videos</a> for more tips that you can put to use immediately. <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/sign-up-for-newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\">Be sure to subscribe!</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheCheckerboardPodcast/~4/jAFWiFDWIFI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

            "description": "<p>The following audio is from a blog post and video in our Marketing-to-Go series. <a href=\"https://www.checkerboard.com/marketingtogo/marketing-go-company-vision/\" target=\"_blank\">Marketing to Go: Company Vision</a></p>\r\n<p>Oh, hi. I'm just planning a route for a secret road trip I'm about to take. I've been looking forward to it for a while now. I've never been to this place, but thanks to GPS and smartphones, I can just put in the address and it will guide me right there.</p>\r\n<p>All of this trip planning actually segues quite nicely into Company Vision. Let’s get into it!</p>\r\n<p>All companies should have a plan for where they want to be in the future. A landmark on the horizon to aim towards. This is what is called a \"company vision\". This is typically created by the company founder or leader and communicated to the rest of the company. That's kind of like the destination for my road trip.</p>\r\n<p>The first thing to keep in mind with a company vision is that it is what the company one day INTENDS TO BE, not what it CURRENTLY IS! It’s purpose after all is to be a goal for the company. Otherwise, that would be like me asking my mapping app for directions to my current location.</p>\r\n<p>(Speaking to smartphone) Give me directions to work.<br />\r\n(Siri) Proceed zero feet. You have already arrived at your destination. Travel time was zero seconds.</p>\r\n<p>Also, you want your company vision statement to be short. That way people will be able to remember, understand, and recall it. If it's too long, it not as valuable. In a similar way, when I tell my GPS my destination, I use an address – which is relatively short and specific, not a long description of the place I want to go.</p>\r\n<p>(Speaking to smartphone) Give me directions to that place I went to last week. You know, the place with the tall green building next to the stop sign?<br />\r\n(Siri) Oh, thank you for that very vague destination. Let me just read your mind to fill in the rest and take you right to the exact location. That was sarcasm. I’m told my voice doesn't express that very well. So I'm telling you.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, reference your company vision periodically to make sure all activities are in line with that vision. At a high level, all company activities should be in line with the course that is set by the company vision. If they’re not, then a refocusing may be in order. Like, if I went off-course during my trip, my GPS would recalculate my route to ensure I arrive at my destination.</p>\r\n<p>(Speaking to smartphone) Hey, isn't the world's largest chocolate waterfall around here? Let’s go there!<br />\r\n(Siri) Recalculating ... Well, the world’s largest chocolate waterfall is in Alaska. That is WAY off course.<br />\r\n(Speaking to smartphone) You’re right Siri. We can’t waste any time getting to my secret destination! After all, it closes at 4:30.</p>\r\n<p>Hopefully this helps you understand \"company vision\" a bit better. Now of course, once you achieve your vision, it's time to create a new one. That helps you avoid stagnation and keeps your company moving forward. </p>\r\n<p>(From off-camera) Hey Shawn, I hear you are going on a trip. Where are you going?<br />\r\nOh, nowhere in particular.<br />\r\n(Siri) Route calculated. Leila's Hair Museum in Independence, Missouri is 425 mi away and you will arrive in approximately 6 hrs.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks Siri.</p>\r\n<p>Ready for more? <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/category/marketingtogo/\" target=\"_blank\">Watch our videos</a> for more tips that you can put to use immediately. <a href=\"http://www.checkerboard.com/sign-up-for-newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\">Be sure to subscribe!</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheCheckerboardPodcast/~4/J-nhB3gM4cM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

We revisit our discussion on “flowery Twitter bios” and look at ways in which our friends, colleagues and heroes represent themselves online – through the blog posts they write, links they curate and share and other output including podcasts and videos.

            "description": "Podcast: Hootsuite Explained in Plain English Hootsuite Explained in Plain English | The Web in Plain English, by Dave Naves. Previously recorded on KAHI Radio 950AM, August 14th, 2015 What are we talking about Dave? Hootsuite? Who?.. Good morning, Sarah how are you I am good… it’s Friday! It is Friday It has been a week a big big week It has… all over the place So yeah let’s talk about Hootsuite what the heck is Hootsuite? Well, let’s home start by saying it’s a social dashboard. It’s a huge time saver Social networking can be kind of ominous and can be a lot of work. You know if you’re doing it right it ~is~ a lot of work but you know the ROI is there. You know one of the problems that many people have social networking is there’s a lot to remember there’s a lot of different accounts: Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Google +, Pinterest… the list goes on. It grows exponentially…daily it seems it really does I concentrate on the big six: Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest and YouTube Those are from my perspective, probably the biggest social networks that. That get the biggest bang for your buck if you do this right. Instagram also is being added soon… it’s going to be part of my big seven. ~In my official list~ But with all that there comes a lot of organization and management and can get a bit crazy with how many examples and how many websites you manage. It has been a while but I can remember when there were a few companies that have created social dashboards meaning a website or in and out there you can go to for free that you can manage all of these social accounts under one single dashboard. So, Hootsuite, in my opinion, appears to be the clear winner in this space. It’s amazing what they have done… over 10 million users now. It allows you, and not only you, but for an entire team securely and safely manage your social space. I’m talking specifically in business now you can definitely use it for personal, but I typically like to talk about business. But you can have team members all over the world help you with your social media management and that’s what Hoostuie is and what it does. They have essentially three different products they offer” The free one or Freemium, which you get to add three social networks. And there is a Pro version of Hootsuite, which you can have up to what is it that I think you can have up to 100 and social profiles and then there’s the Enterprise version of Hootsuite which has unlimited everything. And the Pro it’s 10 bucks a month. It starts at 10 bucks a month the enterprise you have to call because enterprises obviously vary in size. They offer all this that really affordable rates in my opinion. It’s a big time saver. It really is a big time-saver because you can look at a single screen and manage the flow of all this information. And it isn’t just about marketing either. It goes far beyond. I’ve touched on this before but you can do this for sales you can do this for customer service you can do this for for your marketing efforts you can do it to manage your analytics. They have a killer set up set of analytics in there to find out what’s going on in your company. Everyone can have a separate logins and the big boss can check out what’s going on… everybody on down the line can help the company grow socially. And the fact of the matter is that if you’re not paying attention to this you were probably spinning your wheels I fight this spell all the time with customers saying “Dave I don’t have time to do this.” And my answer’s always same, “You don’t have time not to.” This is where business is at. And the future And the future… it’s only growing. So it doesn’t mean it needs to be impossible for you I don’t care how big or how small you are there are tools available so be open-minded about it. This is one tool that allows you to really effectively and efficiently manage your whole social world. And they there’s not too many social networks that this tool doesn’t support as of now...",

It’s that time of the week… one of our favorite times of the week when we have our Web Wizard Dave Naves with Daveworks in the studio it’s the Web in Plain English and today it’s Pinterest and how to make money… good morning Dave Dave: Good morning, Sarah. how are you doing doing well, end of the week Sarah: Yeah always good on Friday when we have the segment because the end the work week and always really good information that you can use and understand so Pinterest, how do we make some money with Pinterest? It confuses the crap out of me. Dave Ha ha ha, Pinterest yeah, you know, it’s probably best to just explain to those who don’t know what interest is as they describe themselves they are a free personalized media platform. so what does that mean? People share pictures, (and videos) that’s what it means… billions and billions pictures at this point of images imagery that interests people, right? Dave: You pin these these pins with pictures that are actually called “pins.” Think of it like having a bulletin board. You take your pin and you pin it to your board. You can have an unlimited number of pins and an unlimited number of boards and its it’s actually very cool. You know, in the beginning I didn’t taste my own medicine and thought “here we go…another social network” and then it took one of my clients to kinda smack me in the face a bit and say “Dave, people think visually.” I thought, Oh… you’re so right. I get. So I immediately, years ago, I joined and I saw how cool it was in the fact that its really brilliant. The business model they have is brilliant because people love looking at pictures. People love sharing pictures and think about it. reading even the comic strip you like it. You like to look at that the imagery and maybe at a couple of captions below, reading you know the comic strip. A lot of people just don’t like reading but they like looking at the pictures. So that’s what Pinterest is about. And one of the things that I teach in in my business is, I’m always trying to make businesses money. One of the things that people might not understand is that you can make a heck of a lot of money using Pinterest… because…and there’s both passive and active ways to do this. Dave: Now, one of the most brilliant moves I’ve seen was made by a company like Nordstrom. They make tons of money through Pinterest. I can guarantee you that every… if you’re in there, on their main account, https://www.pinterest.com/nordstrom, you will see that they have probably every product they offer as a picture on Pinterest. You click once, it gives you a detailed view. You click again, it takes you right to buy it now page. Now that’s active…that’s an active form if sales they use massive traffic that goes on a t Pinterest Sarah: High click-through rates Dave: Oh my.. I mean, if you think about it, they are farming (mispoke: “getting”) their traffic out to Pinterest for free…rather they pay their employees… I’m sure the don’t mind spending tons of money and paying their employees to make it happen, people who were know exactly what fashion is all about.. I’m talking about purses, shoes, anything that Nordsrtom sells is on there. And people click… they like it you click it they’ll often buy it. They make big bucks. So that’s an example of an ~active~ sale on Pinterest. Dave: Pinterest is bound by nothing. People all over the world with all sorts of interests, pin their pictures to their boards. So whether you are in music, you’re in real estate you’re in construction, you’re into clothing or software, its all out there. Many people just pin and it’s fun and you look and you share you share pictures. Whether its gardens I mean I’ve picked up some awesome landscaping pictures off of others’ ideas on landscaping!’ Sarah: Amazing! Dave: What i started doing,",

            "description": "Why You Might Want Your Next Computer to be a Google Chromebook In my business, I’m constantly asked “What kind of computer should I buy?” I usually start blathering about tech specs, needs etc., which normally bores people who just want a simple answer. So I’ve stopped doing that. Most folks just want a computer that WORKS! So, here it is: Are you thinking of getting a new laptop for yourself? Maybe a gift? You might want to check out the Chromebook. Note: Some some of the below links are affiliate-based. All are products and services with which I have personal experience. I am recommending them because I feel they are both useful and helpful… not because of any possible commission. Truly, //D Here’s why you should check out the Chromebook: It’s Affordable The Chromebook retails between $199 – $500, depending on specs. Yep, pretty darn cheap compared to anything else out there. (I have this HP Chromebook) It’s Fast! (even boots in 8 seconds) Nope, I’m not kidding, I couldn’t believe it myself when I first heard about it, but it’s true. (proof below) This computer really is a workhorse. I turn it on, it opens Chrome and I’m off and running. It’s perfect for the Web This computer is all about the web… you open it and start browsing. Read the news, check your email, update your Facebook status… it’s virtually limitless. Or maybe you even want to start blogging… if so, look no further. You’ll Never Lose Your Work It doesn’t have a hard drive. WHAT?? Yep, all your work is saved out in the cloud (Google Drive – AND YES, YOU CAN ACCESS AND EDIT OFFLINE) And yes, it also has a “downloads” folder for files you download. This might sound scary at first, but let me put it to you like this: Would you rather have your 1 hard drive fail (and they always do after a few years) or have your work automatically backed up out on *many* Google servers? Is it secure? In short, YES, VERY. You Can Open and Edit Most Every Microsoft File Type Yep, Excel, Word, PPT, and many more file types your Chromebook (via Google Drive) can open, view and with a small conversion, edit and share the files. But you don’t really need Microsoft at all any more. Google provides everything you need to be productive: Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Contacts, Task List, Chat, G+ Video Hangouts, Google Voice, Wallet… the list goes on. Oh yeah, with Google, most everything is FREE with a massive amount of storage. And you’ll always have the latest and greatest software automatically updated. Quick overview of the Chromebook: Proof the Chromebook Boots 8 seconds: Chromebook Specifications: (My HP 14″ Chromebook) 14” 200 nit display with 16:9 aspect ratio 0.81 inches thin – 4.08 lbs / 1.85 kg Up to 9.5 hours of active use New Intel Processor 100 GB Google Drive Cloud Storage2 with 16GB Solid State Drive Built-in dual band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n HP TrueVision HD Webcam 2x USB3.0, 1x USB2.0 Full size HDMI Port Bluetooth®4.0 Compatible T-Mobile 4G connectivity (optional) What you can do offline on a Chromebook: Read and write emails with Offline Gmail Write a note or make a list with Google Keep Write and edit documents with Google Docs View and RSVP to events with Google Calendar View and edit photos saved with the built-in photo editor Enjoy mp3 files or movies with the built-in media player Here’s the 14″ HP Chromebook I bought: (found the best price on Amazon) HP Chromebook 14-c050 (Sparkling Black) Amazon.com Widgets Here’s a Saved Search at Amazon.

You simply fill up your Buffer with a click of a mouse and the BufferApp automatically posts them for you throughout the day. (at the best times for your particular audience) Why should you care about Buffer? Social networks / micro blogs typically work on a timeline, (latest posts on top) which means that *most* of your audience never sees your posts and shares. If you’re like me and can only research and post every so often, then scheduled posts work much better. How much better? By scheduling your posts correctly, you can increase the number of views and clicks by 200%, double your retweets and significantly increase your Klout score. What the Buffer Dashboard looks like: (click image to zoom) How to Use Buffer Essentially, you add the browser extension for Buffer, (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) find any page content out on the web, click the Buffer Icon, which will add it to your Buffer account.

            "description": "A New Game-Changing Social Network from Google WAIT, WHAT— ANOTHER SOCIAL NETWORK?!? You may be saying to yourself: “I’m barely able to deal with Facebook, Linkedin and Twitter… why should I learn another?” Google+ truly is a game-changing social network that makes sharing on the web far easier with much less noise. How is it a game-changer? Google is the most popular search engine in the world and anything you post “publicly” on G+ is indexed way up there within Google’s Search Results. (So ask yourself: why wouldn’t I want better results on Google by posting on G+?) You can share your insights, links and photos, chat with up to 9 people at once via G+ Hangouts and divide your contacts into G+ Circles. There are also tons of G+ Games and Instant Search always available within Google+ and the G+ mobile version of G+ has made available G+ Instant Upload and G+ Messenger to make your sharing experience easier A quick peak at Google+ Explore Google+ Circles (think friends lists) Within Circles, you can share ideas and knowledge with different people and businesses.. Circles make it easy to organize and categorize your friends in one circle, best frinds in another, your family in another, customers in yet another, and even the town weirdo in a circles all by himself .=) (but they won’t know what circles they are in) Explore Google+ Hangouts (think Video Conferencing, but waaaaay better and easier) Google+ Hangouts are a way of easily communicating with others via video. (watch out Skype and WebEx!) This feature is probably the most powerful within the G+ Arsenal. You can communicate with up to 9 people at a time…. just start a hangout, add who you want there and bam, you’re hanging out! Explore Google+ Games (think time waster – jk!) ;^ ) Are you into playing games? G+ has an entire game room just for you. You can play and share with others who have similar gamining interests. Google+ Search (think search within your biz and personal networks) Hey, remember it’s Google Search… and there is no beter search than that. You can use Google’s phenomenal search algorithm to search your entire social presence. From your friends to experts in certain fields, G+ Search can provide you with immediate results from your circles, news feed globally and public G+ posts. Google+ Mobile (think Google+ on the road) Google+ Instant Upload (think automatic uploading of pics without the fuss) We all love taking photos and sharing them, but pulling those photos from your mobile device and uploading them to the web can be a pain … but with G+ Instant Uploadm it’s automatic so you don’t even need to think about it. Just remembered, keep your loved ones safe by turning off the geo-tag feature in your smartphone. (protect your privacy) Google+ Messenger (think sms/texting/chatting within your chosen groups – *huge* timesaver) Find it hard to text or chat with a bunch of people at once? G+ Messenger consolidates all those separate conversations into one simple group chat, so everyone can converse at once. Very cool! Google+ Sound Interesting?

Previously recorded on KAHI Radio 950AM, August 21st, 2015 Here are some short and sweet videos explaining how it all works: Or, if you just want to go for it, visit Google Voice now. How Google Voice Works: You can choose the account option that works suits you best. Below are the different account types and how they work: Google Voice Number: With this option you get a brand new custom Google number that can receive calls from all of your phones. This means that whenever someone calls your Google number you can set it to ring all of your phones (ex. mobile, home, work phone) or just certain phones. If you just want to use your existing home or work phone, you can get one of these, plug one end into your Internet connection and the other into your phone. Boom, done. FREE phone within the US and *super* cheap International Rates. Google Voice Lite (Voicemail Only) You can have the same voicemail for all your mobile phones. Simply add your existing numbers to Google Voice and then create your own settings, including: personalized greetings, voicemail transcriptions and share voicemail messages.It provides voicemail that feels like email. Here’s exactly how I set it up: Signed up for new Google Voice number Forwarded the old office number for a few months ($28/month – thanks for the ripping me off, AT&T – that’s one of the reasons I left) Plugged in a headset directly to computer to make and receive calls through the Gmail interface Also got my regular office phone to work (not forwarded) with the new Google Voice Number by buying this cool OBi110 Bridge Just plugged one end of this little box into my existing router, and the other into my standard phone Made 1 tiny change within my Google Voice settings BAM, done! Happy with all the features? YES! Ongoing cost? $0 (Bonus!) *note: above mentioned products are Amazon.com affiliate linksGoogle Voice   Features: Google Voice: Voicemail transcription Google Voice: One number Google Voice: Personalized greetings Google Voice: International calling Google Voice: SMS to email Google Voice: Share voicemails Google Voice: Block callers Google Voice: Screen callers Google Voice: Mobile app Google Voice: Conference calls Google Voice: Number Porting Get Google Voice NOW!

But that takes time, and time is something I don&#8217;t have at the moment.</p>\n<p>The plan is to bring SysCast back in a few months. In the meantime, don&#8217;t unsubscribe just yet, keep the RSS feed going. In a few months, I hope to be back &#8211; full force.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, if you&#8217;re craving more open source or linux news, have a look at the weekly newsletter called <a href=\"https://www.cronweekly.com/\">cron.weekly</a>!</p>",
