All done over email for your convenience.\n\nLearn a framework not a language. The framework is a trojan horse for the knowledge you need of the language.\n\n- Learn Rails, not Ruby.\n- Learn Django, not Python.\n- Learn Angular/Ember/React+Redux, not JavaScript.\n- Learn Phoenix, not Elixir.\n- Learn .NET, not C#.\n- Learn Laravel, not PHP.\n- Etc etc.\n\nA few notes from today's episode:\n\n1. Look around at the industry you want to be in, what are other people spending 80% of their time on, that is only getting them 20% of the result? Hard to identify what exactly that is? If you have trouble with this, just identify what people spend 80% of their time on, and do the opposite. This is what makes people massively successful, mark my words.\n\n2. SKIP OVER what you identified in #1. SKIP OVER what most people are doing. This is taking MASSIVE ACTION. Massive action is relative. Relative to the rest of humans on this planet, are you taking massive action? \n\nHere are some examples of taking massive action:\n\n- Learn a Framework: Deploy ANYTHING to Heroku (that only you will see) by tomorrow. No excuses.\n\n- Learn a Framework: complete 1 page that has some functionality you agree with yourself ahead of time, deploy it to Heroku, then send to 2 friends on Facebook and ask them to try and use it. \n\n- Go start interviewing for jobs, NOW. WHY WAIT? Stop sitting around and take action. \n\n- Want to start a podcast? Launch a crappy first version by TOMORROW. \n\n- Want to write a book? Launch a crappy first eBook by next Monday. No matter what.\n\nStop trying to make everything perfect on the first try, just focus on making stuff good on the second try. \n\nYour first handful of job interviews, book chapters, podcast episodes, programming projects - they will all SUCK on the first go around. BE OKAY WITH THAT and push forward and keep going and you will advance beyond the crowd. Most people either A) get obsessed with making the first version perfect and never go anywhere, or B) feel so depressed from their first version being a failure they never go anywhere. SKIP OVER ALL THAT, and get somewhere. \n\nOr don't, and continue to take small actions, and remain in limbo for the rest of your life. \n\nThis is my challenge for you. Are you up for it? Tweet me @dainmiller and let me know you are taking massive actions. Ask me questions on the best massive action to take. I will hold you accountable. You aren't allowed to do small things if you are following me. I will make sure you are accountable. Go to twitter and follow me and let's do this.","pubdate":"2017-01-12T20:34:05.000Z","link":"https://soundcloud.com/starthere-webdev/learn-a-framework-not-a-language","guid":"tag:soundcloud,2010:tracks/302399183","image":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000227802710-27eerh-original.jpg","podcast":{"title":"Start Here: Web Development","description":"Do you want to get your first job as a web developer, or level up in your web dev career??

Gather Context! Read 10 tutorials in your framework & language. 10 is a lot. If you don't know what I mean by this, I recorded an entire portion of an episode on this topic here: http://starthere.fm/webdev/one.\n\n3. Reps and sets: Do 10-25 tutorials. can you do it?\n\n4. BONUS: find mentor to ask questions on ur journey :) twitter is great for this, check out my podcast on networking on twitter here: http://starthere.fm/general/28-how-to-network-and-stay-in-your-comfort-zone-step-by-step-guide-to-networking-for-introverts\n\n4. Project Phase\nA. Learn a version control system & setup git project\nB. Find project online that u suspect uses ur framework and language\nC. Pull out paper and do a \"low fidelity\" mockup of the website that you are seeing.\nD. get basic application up and running by following tutorial \"How to build a blog in FRAMEWORK/LANGUAGE HERE\"\nE. break your mockups into \"sections\" that are tutorials you might find online, then combine the tutorials together into an app\n\n5. BONUS: Ask mentor any questions you might have at this phase\nAttempt to develop relationship with mentor\n\n6. Pre-job last educational push (courses, coaches, further professional development, etc). Modeling a person is a great thing to do in this phase.

For this one guys, there are like 40 options on Amazon. So what you want to do is find a book called \"Discreet Mathematics and Its Applications\". Unfortunately though some versions of this book cost $240 USD, but the good news is some only cost 40 cents. So it varies wildly, and really you can select any version at whatever price you can afford. Here is a direct amazon link to the search result where you can select from the price point you can afford. http://bit.ly/search-for-discrete-text-on-amazon\n- Analysis of Algorithms. For this one, I recommend this book http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1463417791&sr=8-3&keywords=analysis+of+algorithms which is about $60 USD.

The author provides additional resources some of which you can purchase. We don't believe you need to pay for an education in web development so bypass those resources. In step 2 we'd ask you to skip the Build Your First Website section. Our second resource provides a more thorough lesson.\n\n- Work through Lesson 1, Building Your First Web Page, from learn.shayhowe.com\n\nShay's lesson is a crash course and a fantastic introduction to HTML and CSS. Technically, it's a lesson about building for the front-end but we think every web developer should know these things.\n\n- Talk to Us\n\nPlease tell us why you want to be a web developer.
